      "my 12 year old sheltie has chronic brochotitis, been on meds for three years, these help with the coughing fits at night. so I like them!!!<br /> one bite and both my dogs are addicted!!! be warned!!! 7 pm both shelties are on my lap howling for the drug fix! I am a dog trainer and have never seen  anything like it....<br /><br />three weeks later,, the beloved sheltie got a bowel blockage from these, use with caution.<br />if the cat gets too many she has the runs....<br />sheltie did better when i upped her thryoid meds, and gave her doggie asthma meds.<br />so it worked better for the 18 year old cat, who also has asthma.\n",
      "These are genuine Greenies product, not a knockoff.  My dogs love them!  It is their favorite treat.  I have 2 small dogs, both under 10 lbs. and the Teenie size is perfect for them.  I paid $22.37 for this 96-pack and it is by far the best price I have found anywhere.  I wish these were part of the Subscribe & Save program.\n",
      "Our dogs love Greenies, but of course, which doggies don't?  I bought this for my dashchund and minpin, and it's perfect!  A great price for a great product.  Who could ask for more.\n",
      "What can I say, dogs love greenies. They begg for them all the time. They always sit by the cupboard and ask for more.\n",
      "This review is for a box of Greenies Lite for my dog. The package came quickly and was packaged appropriately. I was very satisfied with this purchase and with the seller.\n",
      "I highly recommend these chews for your dog. They do exactly what they say that they will do; freshen your dog's breath!<br /><br />I found them to be significantly cheaper to buy them at Amazon compared to the chain pet stores; at least $10 cheaper as of Sept. 2011.<br /><br />I have read that some dogs do not chew them well enough and have choked. I have not had that happen to my dog but it is probably something you need to take into consideration.<br /><br />My advice is to buy a smaller bag at a pet store first and see if they work for your animal. Then come back and buy them here!\n",
      "I have always used Greenies for my dogs. THese for seniors are wonderful. I have an elderly bulldog with really bad breath. She used to swallow the original Greenies whole so I quit buying them for her. She actually does chew these and eat them and they make a big difference in how her breath smells. Great product and the price is better than I have seen it in some local pet stores.\n",
      "If you've got hard chewers (like one of our dogs), these things won't really work for the 'brushing' aspect -- they're bussted up and swallowed pretty quickly. We have three Chihuahua mixes, and they dispatched these petite ones too quickly, so we get them the next size up (small, I think). But the product is good, and they really do help a bit with breath -- although the biggest bad-breath-maker is teeth that need brushing, and there is no substitute for real brushing/cleaning.  These are good as part of the process though. We have, and will continue to purchase this product.\n",
      "I tried Greenies on my dog about 8 years ago and he won't eat them.  So I tried dental rawhide chews which he chewed just fine.  My dog is now 13 years old and he started to swallow the dental rawhide whole and would choke on them.  I'm not sure because of his age that he tries to swallow them whole, but I'm sure it's not good for him.  I thought I would try the Greenies again because the reviews are good and they break into bits when chewed.  I order the large Greenies for him and he loves them.  I'm not sure if they changed the taste or what, but he chews them, and hopefully it will help maintain his teeth.\n",
      "This is a fabulous treat for my little cavalier king charles. He looks forward to it after his daily dental cleaning. I cut each greenie into smaller pieces, because JB (for James Bond) has long ears and he chews on the smaller pieces without letting anything fall on the floor and sticking to his ears.\n",
      "I am the lucky parent of three dogs. I alternate their teeth cleaning chews and they love the Greenies and the Checkups best. Thanks to Amazon, I don't have to pay for S&H, which living in Alaska, usually costs a fortune!! Thank you Amazon!! I prefer to purchase from our local pet store, but they aren't able to get the Greenies or the Checkups, so I'm very happy that I can order them through Amazon.\n",
      "This is a great product. My 2 year old Golden Retriever hates to have his teeth brushed and this product made his teeth white again. Great seller and great price too!\n",
      "I was looking for a way to help clean my cat's teeth so at first I tried the feline greenies,but he wouldn't have anything to do with those. I went to the local pet store looking for an alternative and the clerk suggested trying the dog greenies instead. I was skeptical at first so I only bought a couple of individually wrapped samples. Well, my cat absolutely loves the dog greenies! They do seem to help his breath, but I don't know how much they help the plaque and tartar build up. Oh well, it has become the only treat he likes so I will keep buying bulk boxes. I give him one every day, occasionally two, if I need to bribe him to stay inside when I open the door.\n",
      "Greenies are an excellant way to whiten your dogs teeth. The costs were much lower here, than what you can buy locally at the dog food stores. They have made a great improvment in my dog(s) breath, tarter and overall mouth smell!\n",
      "My dogs are addicted to these things and it's my fault.  Whether or not they are good for my dog's teeth and digestive health is up in the air. All I know is that it keeps them quiet and they will do anything for them.<br /><br />I would lower the star ratings based on the fact that the manufacturer knows they have, some what, of a monopoly and charge an inordinate amount for these treats; yet, I am dumb enough to buy them so it's basically my fault.<br /><br />At least by buying on Amazon you are saving some dollar bills as compared to a traditional brick and mortar.<br /><br />My only gripe is that by the time you get to the end of the box, even if you seal the bag, they get significantly harder and I am somewhat concerned that they will splinter.<br /><br />Also, be sure to watch over your dog when he eats them, just to be safe.\n",
      "this product does help to cleen the teeth, but doesnt really help to get rid of the bad breath of my pom..But still a good buy, cause the size is perfect for small breed dogs\n",
      "My dogs love their Greenies, and their teeth are pearly white from chewing on them.  The only problem is that Greenies are expensive, so I buy them in bulk on Amazon to keep the prices down a little bit,\n",
      "My dog loves greenies - she waits for them everyday!  We give her one regular sized one per day and the teenies as treats for going outside etc.  I have heard that these do not digest easily if your dog is not a chewer.  My dog is a chewer so it works out great.  She is addicted!\n",
      "Super fast shipping, even included a couple trial treats.  Our dog loves these and we'll be purchasing them again!\n",
      "My dog looks forward to a Greenie dessert everyday.  You will NOT find this deal at the local pet stores.  I love the fact that I get a good deal at Amazon.  I save time and gas.  My dog thanks us both.\n",
      "Perform as promised.  No problems with \"blobs\" since my dog chews 'em up real well.\n",
      "Great treat for all doggies, very healthy and they adore them.  Excellent and fast shipping,will buy again.\n",
      "My little dogs really like these \"teenie\" Greenies dental chewies. Not only are they good for the dogs' teeth, the dogs consider them a treat! I am not able to find these really small Greenies elsewhere; the smallest I can find in the stores are \"petites\" which are too large for these little dogs to chew.  So, thank you for making these available.  I was very pleased with the service; these arrived here quickly and in excellent condition!  I will order from this website again!\n",
      "I have two Airedales.  They aren't fussy eaters - or snackers - but each gets a Greenie at bedtime.  We let them out in the yard for a bit before they go to bed and all I have to do is say \"Time for your Greenies!\" to make them race for the house and dance around until they get that bedtime snack.  It's their special treat and I love the fact that they actually have to chew them moderately slowly instead of just inhaling them!  The only drawback is that they're expensive.\n",
      "I was very happy with the quick delivery and how I was given a tracking method to determine where my Greenies were. I'll telling my friends and relatives about the good experience.\n",
      "What can I say my dog goes crazy over these things - wish I really understood what are in them that makes it so desirable...now if we could only do this for vegetables so kids would be excited!!\n",
      "He weighs 15 pounds, so he is just at the top of the range for the teenie size Greenies.  He likes them so much, he would probably prefer the Jumbo size!  I've given him these for his whole life, so I don't know if they get his teeth any cleaner than without them, but his teeth look pretty clean to me!\n",
      "Ive been buying this product for a few years and am very happy with it. My dog loves them.\n",
      "Ok, can I just express how much my dog loves Greenies.  I know that there have been reports of problems with dogs inhaling them without chewing them well and thus having digestion problems, but my dog savors them.  She freaks out when she knows she's going to get one and will heard whomever is getting it right to the place we store them.  She knows if we talk about them so we have to call them G's to each other.  She will tolerate other treats if I'm waiting for an order from Amazon, but she doesn't like it.  The only downfall is the price.  I can usually find a pretty good deal somewhere on Amazon and so I'll stock up on them when I can.  If I can't, she has to wait and substitute with something else.\n",
      "Stopped being able to find large quantities locally so glad that Amazon has vendors who are selling them at a great price.\n",
      "<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KBFKIQ\">Greenies Dental Chews - 27 ounce Box - Petite - 45 count</a> Very good product delivered promptly at a fair price. Will order more from this site.\n",
      "My dog is the pickiest eater and does not enjoy many treats but he goes crazy over this one. It helps freshen his breath but I don't know how to evaluate the cleaning ability of this product. The only bad thing is that it will make your dog fat if he eats too much.\n",
      "Half way through the supply, I noticed that there were tiny white worms boring through a greenie so I checked the remaining greenies and they also had worms.  Please empty the contents of the box and check the greenies when you receive your order before giving them to your dog.  This may have been an isolated incident but it would only take a few minutes to check the contents for freshness.\n",
      "I will continue to give these to my dogs. They like them and supposedly they clean their teeth.<br />I started to give these to my dog daily, but her digestive system did not like it enough for that. Most of it seems to be digestible, but she threw up green foam on the morning after the second day in a row of eating one-a-day greenies. Note that she was also constipated as well. Greenie advises to have plenty of water available for drinking these, so I am guess they know these side effects can occur. My dog has plenty of water available, but she didn't drink any more than normal, which may have resulted in the effects. I don't plan on training my dog to drink lots of extra water after eating these. Giving here one every now and then shows no negative effects, and that what I plan on doing.<br />Not a complaint to me, but I think people who like giving there dog all natural health food should know that this product is far from \"green.\" It is pumped pull of artificial ingredients like a multivitamin. It is also made from concentrated grain protein, rather than the animal protein dogs should be getting. I personally don't feel that this is that big of a deal health wise for a creature than lives 12-18 years, but or people who invest the extra money on organic/natural dog food, you should be staying away from this product.\n",
      "I ordered the GREENIES 'PETITE' size for my dogs, as I have done many times  before thru Amazon.  This time however, the WRONG size greenies arrived.  The thing is, the box DID say it was the PETITE size on it!  After I opened the box, I found that it was the next size up and too big for my dogs to eat.  Now I have to try & cut these stinkers with a scissors each day!  I'm NOT happy...but I couldn't return them as I had opened the package.<br />I am afraid to order more, as the entire batch that Amazon has, may ALL be MIS-labled!\n",
      "Paid only $22 with free shipping for 96 teenies compared to about $35 at the pet store. How can you go wrong with a deal like that?  The dog begs for his daily Greenie. Got to have them.\n",
      "How well the dogs would eat them.  Glad to know the benefits the animals get from chewing them, both for teeth cleaning and breathe.  Safety us always an issue.\n",
      "i bought this for my dog - he loved it.  however, i noticed that he stopped pooping and came to realize (after googling) that it caused him to be constipated.  His stomach was very bloated and I could feel that his colon was obstructed by something -- a piece of undigested greenies treat.  I gave him all some olive oil and mineral oil and massaged his colon and eventually he started pooping again.  I did notice that the greenie came out undigested!  This product is really dangerous and I would love to join in on a class action lawsuit against this unethical company.  They have made greenies 'tasty' but that is all it is.  a tasty but dangerous product.\n",
      "I buy the teenie greenies and break them in half for our dogs.  They go nuts over them no matter what the size.  Having them in a \"lite\" version is even better because the vet did tell me they are high in calories.  Don't know what they put in these things to make them so appealing, but haven't known a dog yet who doesn't love them.  Hope they are also doing the job they are meant to do.\n",
      "Greenies are always a good product.  Our dog loves them and reminds us if we forget to give him one.  Plus I love the price on Amazon and can't always get them locally.\n",
      "My vet is always surprised how clean my 8 year old dog's teeth are and I attribute this the his daily Greenie.\n",
      "Our beautiful Belle loves her daily toothbrush treat. Amazon provides an awesome price and delivers them to our doorstep. That makes it even handier. The Greenies are a proven winner for a more natural breath freshening dog treat. Too bad Greenies doesn't get more 'green' with their packaging and lose the outer box that they use. The sealed inside bag would be plenty good enough. It keeps the treats fresh and takes up less space. The first thing we do is toss the box out--- what a waste!\n",
      "In September, I adopted 2 adult border terrier mixes from The Shelter Pet project and the oldest girl had a few \"breath\" issues.  Heard about Greenies and have not been disappointed.  The two of them love their treat before I go to work and it is comical to see them chew and chew and chew, since that is what removes the tartar. Amazon has much better pricing then the pet centers, so I love it.  Try them for your pet, they will love it.\n",
      "This is the first time I bought this product for my 9 yr old yorkie... and she loved it!  The small size is perfect for her.  This box of greenies will give her many days of enjoyment!\n",
      "These tinnie greenies make the perfect \"out the door\" bribe for my Cavlier King Charles Babies. I think they almost look forward to me going to work now.  Barkley is 21 lbs & Gypsy is 18 so while they are a bit larger than the recommended size for the product it really works out perfectly helping keep the pounds off.<br /><br />Having shopped around, you are saving about ten dollars by ordering from Amazon rather than going into a big box pet store.\n",
      "My Chihuahua has horrible horrible breath.... and she loves to get in your face and give kisses to everyone. These help, and she loves to eat them. Good thing she can't reach the counter!\n",
      "My dog likes thse alot..He runs to his bedroom to eat them, which is reserved for just his special treats..Can't say his breath is any better but he just started eating them a month ago,or so..\n",
      "Bought the Jumbo Greenies for my Black Lab. He loved them, but at $2.66 each they are way too expensive for regular use.  Didn't notice any difference in breath which was the primary reason for buying.\n",
      "Our two thirteen year dogs like these.  They're prone to major tartar build up on their teeth and these helped some and made their breath better.  I never expected these to polish the teeth perfectly but they made a bad condition not so bad.\n",
      "This is a good product. My dog likes them, Makes it obvious he wants his greenie every night. Amazon sells them at good price and quality has always been good\n",
      "I have a two year old chihuahua mix.My vet shared with me that I would have to be vigilant about the health of my Pups teeth.Greenies help keep my dogs teeth clean and his breath fresh. And best of all my Pups loves them above all other treats.\n",
      "Great product.  My dog loves the bones and they come in a ziplock bag inside the box.  Just like the ones at the store and much cheaper at Amazon.\n",
      "Our Chussel's Love these toothbrush treats. When I ask them if they want to brush their teeth, they jump a mile high to get them. It dosent help their breath to to much, but I know its keeping their teeth clean. Also these are a little on the expensive side almost everywhere, Amazon has the best price. Thanks Amazon.\n",
      "I have two 6 month old dobemans who asked me to rate Greenies 6 out of five. It is yet to be seen how it will improve their dental health, but as far as their excitement about this particular treat - it is the best, no doubt.\n",
      "Great product, it was exactly what I wanted.  I ordered the medium size because my shi tzu LOVES greenies so much! Good deal for the price considered how expensive they are at petco!!\n",
      "Had been buying greenies at the pet store for the past 7 years, best price on sale was $32.99. These are a great value.\n",
      "Great service, great product, our dogs LOVE them!  Great for their teeth, and it keeps them from eating grass if they have one first thing in the morning!\n",
      "My little Oliver loves his greenies.......He gets 1 everymorning thanks to such a good buy we are sure to have them every day.........\n",
      "Anytime I shout out \"Mr. Greenie! Four dogs come running, ages 12 to 2. My dogs love them and they do seem to help with breath and tarter. Amazon has the absolute best prices.\n",
      "This is a wonderful product that my dog really loves.  there is only one thing to make this product better - 30 chews in the box so we would have one for every day of the month.\n",
      "Greenies are my pups number one favorite treat.  He loves them and they help keep his teeth clean. I reccomend these to anyone who wants to spoil their pet.\n",
      "These are a great size for an evening snack.  My dog loves them and \"insists\" on having one or two every night.\n",
      "We are very pleased with our purchase of Greenies.  The price was grteat (compared with the pet stores) and the service was excellent.  Our dog is even more pleased than we are - he loves them.\n",
      "Our mini Dachshund loves these. Limited to 1 a day. One of the few \"treats\" that he has not tired of. Also, his breath has been noticeably fresher since he has been having these. So far, best price on Amazon. The local pet food chains' sale prices has not yet come close to the regular price of these 96 count 'Teenie' packs. Can't vouch on the benefit of nutritional value of these, but the vet says our mini is in great shape ...right where he is suppose to be.\n",
      "Not only my logs like these snacks... ME TOO because their mouth isn't stinky anymore! ;) I will keep on buying it because of that reason. DOG LOVERS: you will like this product.\n",
      "I've been using this product for almost 2 years and my dogs seem to like it.  However, last box/bag had all 96 greenies stuck together in a huge ball.  Maybe it was the heat or maybe something happened during packaging.  Either case, I have to pull off 1 at a time when it comes to snack time.\n",
      "My little Papillon, Piccolo absolutely LOVES these. I no longer have to try to brush his teeth every evening and he smells delicious when I kiss him good night. I'LL BE GETTING THESE FROM YOU FOR AS LOG AS WE BOTH MAY LIVE!<br /><br />THANK YOU, AMAZON!!!!!\n",
      "They're a great product and automated delivery at great prices can't be beat!  My dogs go crazy when it comes to greenie time at night.  No matter how many nights we do the same thing they are always over the top for greenies\n",
      "I have 2 small dogs and one really small dog.  They all get one Greenie a day.  They LOVE their greenies!1 I love that the Greenies help to keep their mouths fresh and clean. They are adorable and are shaped like a mini toothbrush!!!\n",
      "Greenies are given to both of my Westies and they expect one a day when they complete their morning routine.  Best treat ever.\n",
      "My little ones love their teenie greenies. It is so easy to order them from Amazon. Greenies are recomendid by my vet to help keep my dachshunds teeth clean and healthy.\n",
      "Did some research because my dogs have bad breath and dirty teeth. I have tried brushing their teeth with doggie toothpaste and have bought all kinds of chewy treats but nothing worked. So I bought these and gave each dog a treat every morning.  Not only does their breath smell better but their teeth look cleaner as well. I quickly bought a second box. The dogs seem to enjoy the taste and they are made so that the dog can't just gulp them down.  They have to chew them.  I would highly recommend these treats.\n",
      "My dog loves these treats and they are lite too.  I have been buying them for the last 5 years\n",
      "These bones are great for a dog's breath. However, I was looking for something that would take him more than a minute to chew. Still a good treat for doggy breath.\n",
      "I have subsribed to the monthly shipment of Greenies 27 oz canister teenie 96 count product and each month the price increases.  If i sign up today the price drops to $19.94.  Why the increase?  Seems like they lock you in for a scheduled order and then take advantage of you hoping that you won't notice the price increases.<br /><br />The product is great and my dogs love them but the business practice of the price hikes is terrible.\n",
      "Einstein our puppy loves the Greenies.  He get's one at night before bed as a bribe for going into his kennel.  Works wonders:)  Since, he gets one every night we go through the Greenies fairly quickly.  I like the larger size and was actually cheaper per piece.<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G96UK8\">Greenies 27 oz Canister Teenie 96 Count</a>\n",
      "I've only given Greenies four stars because they're pretty costly at one Greenie per day (and we have two dogs).  That said, we stopped giving our dogs Greenies for a period of time and there was a significant amount of brown-colored build up around the base of our dogs' teeth.  We started giving them Greenies again and within a short period of time the build-up was gone in most areas and, overall, greatly reduced.  I realize that we could brush our dogs teeth in order to avoid the cost, but neither of us wants to take on this chore; plus, the dogs LOVE Greenies.<br /><br />I used to buy this product at Petsmart, but they're much less expensive on Amazon.\n",
      "My two dogs love these.  Now as to do they work.  I honestly do not know.  Both of my dogs are right now at what my vet calls stage two on dental health.  Stage four is the worst on his scale.  I am going to monitor and see IF just maybe they will either still be a stage two in a year or maybe better.  If they maintain at stage two I would love it.  Teeth cleaning on dogs is very expensive so if this product works it will save me big bucks.  Here's hoping!  I will come back and update this after their next check up which should be around August of 2013.\n",
      "Nothing negative to say about this buying experience.  My dog loves Greenies, and this was a better price than what I have seen elsewhere.  Treats like this, along with regular dental care (brushing her teeth and getting her teeth professionally cleaned by a vet) means that my dog's breath is nice and she is healthier.  My dog is 7kgs (around 15 lbs)and this is a perfect size for her.  The packaging keeps these treats fresh - inside the box is an airtight resealable bag.\n",
      "My dog looks forward everyday to getting his Greenies.  It is a great toothbrush and keeps him from having too much tarter on his teeth.\n",
      "I am always concerned with my dogs oral health. I have found that my dogs love the Greenies and they do a good job of helping to keep the tarter build up off their teeth! I have one dog that is very particular about his treats and what he will chew on but he loves the Greenies, in fact my dogs will do most anything I ask so long as they know they get a Greenie afterwards!\n",
      "Always had trouble trying to brush my dog's teeth; thought I would try the Greenies Petite (16 lb cockapoo). They are plenty big enough. She has one everyday loves them and her teeth are looking very healthy; no tartar build up. Definitely recommend them.\n",
      "My dog love it, and She's a very, very picky eater- even with treats. So, this product must have a great flavor.\n",
      "Both of my small breed dogs love their greenies treat and I like that it is good for their dental health,,\n",
      "my german shepherd goes crazy for these things. i have no idea why he likes them so much. his breath is always pretty good, so i guess these work well. good deal for the scheduled delivery option.\n",
      "I have a (now) 6 month old miniature daschund puppy. I bought these for her about two months ago when I started to be a little bothered by her breath (she's a kisser). I bought them from amazon because they were so much cheaper then at the local pet store.<br />At first, she had no interest in them. I was a little annoyed, having bought a box of 96 that was still expensive for dog treats even with the discount. She either would ignore it no matter how many times I tried reintroducing it, or take a bite then leave it. It took a few weeks and several tries, but now she loves them and eats them as soon as I give it to her. I give her at most one a day but usually one every two or three days. It hasn't upset her stomach or anything like that. The package says they aren't suitable for dogs under 6 months of age, but I stared giving them to her at about 4 months and there were no problems. She has clean, healthy teeth, but I don't think she wouldn't if I stopped giving her these. They do work in freshening her breath, however. We have a 3 year old golden retriever in the house who eats these sometimes too and has loved them since the day they came- I guess it just depends on the dog. Even though they're not the correct size for him, he's never choked and I don't think it's a problem to buy the smaller size for a larger dog. I'd definitely recommend these if you want your dog's breath freshened!\n",
      "We have been feeding these to our do since he became an adult dog.  We feed him the Jumbo size Greenies. He's 125+ pounds and devours them in seconds.  We order them from Amazon, because we can rarely find the Jumbo size greenie canisters in stores.  Our dog's teeth seem to be in really good condition.  We have never had any problems with him eating them or with his digestion.  We always give him one when we are around to watch and he's never had any issues.\n",
      "I bought these for my 9 yr old dog because the vet said she had stage 4 dental disease, and we really couldn't afford the $300+ price of teeth cleaning for her. I decided to give her one Greenie everyday and see if it improved her teeth and gums. I have been giving her one a day for almost two months and her back teeth look so much better! I am very happy with this little experiment and she is too. She reminds me every night when it's time for her Greenie treat. She still has a slight issue with one of her front teeth, but I think it's because she mainly chews the Greenies on her back teeth. Such a great item. Much cheaper on Amazon than at the pet store.\n",
      "I have a 10yr. old boxer and she has worn much of her teeth down some what.  She loves these and they help her breath and clean her teeth.  If she likes them, then MoM likes them.\n",
      "My Boston Terrier gets one Greenie regular each day to keep teeth clean. Should I forget it's time for her Greenie, she sits and stares at me until I remember. Vet says her teeth are in great shape.\n",
      "Patches loves these and will put up with teeth brushing since he knows he'll get a Greenie at the end of it.\n",
      "My dog loves them, and so does our vet?  Our Yorkie likes to eat unhealthy things, but shys away from healthy ones.  The lone exception are Greenies.\n",
      "My dog loves these snacks.  I have a smaller rat terrier mix dog she loves these even more than Cherrio's.  They come in a canister which is flimsy but I threw it away as they are also in a resealable bag. They should last a fairly long time as I don't give them to her daily, only for special treats and after she takes any medicines.\n",
      "I have been buying 96-count containers of teeny greenies from Amazon for a couple of years.  They are always fresh and arrive promptly. My Yorkies look forward to one before bedtime each evening.  I don't know if they really help plaque.  They do freshen breath and have some nutrition.  Thanks to Amazon prices, my dogs have this little luxury.\n",
      "We have two shelties and their breath improved almost immediately with this product.  One of our dogs has a problem digesting another brand, but neither dog had a problem with the Greenies.  Highly Recommend.\n",
      "Ever since I introduced my dog to Greenies, she just loved them. They are her favorite treats, and they are good for her too! She weighs about 15 pounds and I give her one each morning after her walk. I purchase the 27 oz canister, Teenie size (96 count).\n",
      "This is a great treat for my dogs. I've been buying them for 12 years and they never turn it down.\n",
      "These are given to my 2 rescue dogs at the end of the day.  They know when it is time to go out for the last time at night and sit and wait for their Greenie.  All we have to say is \"do you want to brush your teeth\" and they go nuts.  They love them and their teeth are in great shape...\n",
      "My dog loves these. I also bought them way cheaper than the pet store. Next time it's offered for the price I paid I will buy a few boxes again\n",
      "So far so good. My dog seems to love this things. They do stink when you open the box so beware. I don't know how well they preventing the plaque from building up on his teeth only time will tell. 4stars based on potential good it will do for my dog and the fact that he loves them. You do get alot to last you for 96 days b/c it only says to give one a day so I think that will be adequate time to fully evaluate. I'll update when that time comes but for now it's worth giving it a shot.\n",
      "I have been feeding our dogs Greenie bones since they first came out and we have NEVER had a problem.  I have German Shepards, Dobermans and medium sized hound dogs.  They all love their GB's and I find that because our Dobie tends to be a \"garbage belly\" (meaning she'll eat anything!), so sometimes she doesn't smell as nice as she should, really benefits from the \"green\" in Greenie Bones.  I would like to know where \"E. Antic\" gets his/her information from.....as I can find nothing that says they are \"deadly\", except for those people that haven't done responsible research (not just hearsay from some list).  If your dogs are gulpers or greedy chewers, then I wouldn't feed them ANYTHING, especially RAWHIDE, that could be gulped and swallowed in large pieces or whole.  Do we need to bring up \"NYLABONES\"?????  Always be a responsible dog owner and supervise your dogs when giving any kind of treats.  Please don't be afraid of Greenie Bones because of E. Antic's post.  You can buy Greenie's in singles, so try one before you commit to a whole box.  I have friends that have dogs that don't really like them and that's okay.  My girls live for their morning GB's and I now give them Greenie \"Smart Biscuits\" for an afternoon snack.  They love the taste and we love them for the 'benefits'!!<br /><br />I respectfully request that Amazon and Amazon members make up their own minds, and not fall to the 'fear mongers' and ignorance amoung us.  Always supervise your dogs when giving treats - after all, they are the animals and we are supposed to be the 'smart' ones.....don't be afraid, do your homework, it always pays!\n",
      "i still worry about the rumored threat to dogs from these treats, but they have changed the formula so i am assuming all is well with them.  and i am assuming since they are front and center in most pet places that they are safe.  and my italian greyhound is obsessed with them.  they make her (usually hideous) breath smell fresh and clean and have really made a difference in the cleanliness of her teeth.  i always make sure to watch her while she's eating it, not only for her safety, but because it is freaking adorable to watch her chew on it.  just a tip, these are cheaper from entirelypets from amazon.  http://www.amazon.com/Greenies-Dental-Chews-ounce-Teenie/dp/B001CWEC2W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=home-garden&qid=1266273814&sr=8-1\n",
      "My German Shepherd is a complete Greenie addict.  She knows when they're in the house.  She knows which cupboard they're kept in.  She knows what time of day she's supposed to get hers.  Her vet compliments her on her pretty white teeth, although some of that credit definitely has to go to the fact that my husband and I brush her teeth with one of those finger-toothbrushes and kiddie toothpaste (no fluoride, so safe if she swallows it), but I do know my dog chews a Greenie at least enough to get pieces between her teeth, and at four years old, she doesn't have the kind of doggie breath that knocks you over if she breathes in your face.  I do believe that some of the ingredients in Greenies help breath from within, so even if your dog inhales his or her Greenie, there's still some benefit.<br /><br />My only complaint about Greenies is that they're expensive.  There's no denying that.  If you do the math on this tub of 17, we're talking about a dollar and forty-seven cents apiece.  So I can see why that might stop some people in their tracks, and I understand.  As for my dog, she's on a limited diet because she's allergic to a lot of things that are standard ingredients in a lot of dog food and dog treats.  I feel like I've been a little bit trained myself, not to bat an eye at this price, and she definitely makes me at least a dollar and a half's worth of happy every day.<br /><br />If you're looking at the Greenies in the 17-piece tub, considering them for purchase, though, I'm guessing your canine is also a Greenie addict, like mine.  You're going to buy them anyway, and if you get the free shipping, Amazon's the place to get them.\n",
      "I have been using Greenies for years, including the older formula that reportedly had digestion problems. However, we never have had any problems with Greenies. Just make sure you get the appropriate size for your dog. I have never seen a dog that could resist a Greenie. They will start doing tricks never seen before once you bring them into the house. They do help with their breath, teeth cleaning and training and we normally use them as \"well earned\" treats (they aren't the cheapest thing in the treat world). I just ordered 4, 27 oz. tubs of the Teenies (we have Papillons) and I know our dogs will enjoy every one of them. Never have to worry about our dogs getting fat eating these as we do not give them multiple times a day. The new formula reportedly has solved the digestibility problem and the manufacturer claims is now more digestible than normal dog food. In the original formula, the problem usually involved incidents when dogs just tried to swallow them whole or get it down in 2 bites. Our dogs always chewed them into small pieces avoiding any problems. Believe me, your dogs will love them.\n",
      "I give these to my dog to help with her minor tartar problems. She LOVES them and they definitely do the job.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about them is that they are sturdy and coated enough that I can freeze them--I put one in a small plastic bag (snack bag folded in half) full of water and freeze it for a few hours. Then my dog has to lick and crunch up the ice to get to the treat, which keeps her busy AND gets her more fluids. Most dog treats tend to dissolve and become mushy when you do this with them, but these guys definitely hold up.\n",
      "My dogs, the 1st day I tried these, didn't really seem to like them. Now they practically climb up me to get to them. My older dog was having trouble with tarter and bad breathe.  After 2 weeks of using the treats, her teeth looked a lot better and the nasty odor was gone.  The reason for the 4 stars is because of the expense, which for me is times 2.\n",
      "First some history:<br />Our dog can't chew rawhide bones.  She has a habit of breaking off pieces & swallowing them whole.  We have had problems with blockages & constipation as a result -- everytime she has received a rawhide.<br /><br />We have a 13 yr old Beagle which was introduced to Greenies about 2 yrs ago.  We were given a couple of the Large ones from a friend to try.  Through carelessness on our part, our dog destroyed both large treats within 15 minutes.  When we found her, we were scared figuring she would die from swallowing this large plasticky looking treat.  We quickly did some web searches & found out that the newer formula is supposed to dissolve rather easily with water.  After making sure she drank a good amount of water, we monitored her activity.  In the end, she had no problems & we were able to find a treat that is more chewable than your biscuit type treats, but safer than rawhide (at least for her).  We have tried many different treats & toys, but have NEVER had the type of response that we get from giving her a Greenie.  It seriously is like crack for dogs...\n",
      "My dogs love them and they really help in freshening my dogs' breaths! This is the most cost-efficient pack I could find.\n",
      "We have been buying Greenies for Pepper for about 4 years.  He has a very sensitive stomach and can only have boiled chicken and canned and dry prescription diet ID<br />I brush his teeth every night and afterwards he gets a \"greenie\"  he loves them and I love that they don't upset his stomach.<br />Our Vet said they should be ok for Pepper.  And they are.  Paying about 40.00 elsewhere, I'm really happy to find them on Amazon.com for a little over half of that.  Pepper is happy and I'm happy.\n",
      "It's got something in there that is like crack for dogs. I buy the largest size I can find. I like them better than rawhide, for what they do. Rawhide strips or bones, when the dog gets down to that last part are slimy unswallowable messes that I've had to reach in and remove from the dog's throat. Nylabones edibles gave the dog the runs. Pressed rawhide chunks did the same. Greenies don't affect his digestion at all, and he's crazy about them. He has destroyed a Kong or two in his time.<br /><br />I don't know how much is due to his genes or to the greenies, but my 12 year old dog has better teeth than many 5 year olds.<br /><br />Like any other edible chew treat, however, don't leave your dog unattended until he's finished it.\n",
      "My dog no longer needs to have his teeth cleaned by the vet, since he gets one grenie every day.\n",
      "Both of my German Shepherds love their daily Greenies.  Matty jumps up on my bed at noom every day to remind me to get off my butt and produce her treat!\n",
      "Since I have three dogs buying treats can get very spendy. I am so glad that I shop at Amazon.com they offer such great deals for me as wells for my little four legged kids. Truthfully I have to say that I have been extremely satisfied with all of my purchases . I am grateful that Amazon offers such wonderful deals Thank you\n",
      "my dog love it very much, the fist thing that she wake up in the morning is eat the greenies!\n",
      "These treats for small dogs are #1 on my dog's list of morning must haves.<br />She has been pestering me to give her a morning teenie chewy every day for many<br />months. She does not seem to tire of these unlike many treats she has tried.<br />I have heard that the official word is that these do not really promote good breath.<br />Maybe they just limit the amount of bad breath. Whatever. This box is a three<br />month supply so is a reasonably economical way to give my dog something she really likes.\n",
      "Little Lulu, my six month old Miniature Scnauzer, developed foul breath. It reeked like a dead fish, and I couldn't handle her puppy kisses any more.  Then, I saw an ad on TV for a competing product, but found these to be a better deal. They are worth every penny.<br /><br />The Teenie Greenies arrived yesterday. Just ONE solved the problem. I gave it to her half expecting her to turn her nose up. Instead, she loved it. This morning she greeted me with sloppy kisses and wiggles. I instinctively cringed, waiting for that fetid smell. But there was NO smell! Zilch. Zip. Nada.\n",
      "Dogs love greenies. Awesome product. Super price. Item was shipped very rapidly. Great packaging. Overall wonderful experience. All animals are happy!\n",
      "My dog thinks it is crack! He is crazy over these teenie greeinies. Arived on time and cheeper than the store for sure. I would recomend to all.\n",
      "Greenies are the special treat we give our golden retriever and great pyrenee/golden retriever mix.  Greenies are hard enough that our dogs have to chew slowly but not so hard that I feel uncomfortable giving it to them.\n",
      "Plain and simple, my dog loves these. She dances, spins, & squeaks whenever one is brought out! While this makes me happy as well, it is important to say that regular feedings of 1 to 2 a week have helped avoid teeth cleanings and extractions over the years! Too bad they don't have an equivalent for humans!\n",
      "Penny loves it. She keeps asking for more and more :)<br />I was very glad to know that because its healthy, cheap and tasty. I definitely will buy more, next time!\n",
      "Started buying these for my dog and he loves them. They are easy on his teeth (not too hard, etc) and my vet complimented that his teeth are in good condition. Your dog may need teeth cleaning once in awhile (it's not a substitute) but it mitigates the tartar buildup effectively when given daily. Will buy over and over again.\n",
      "For a picky boxer that doesn't like or eat many treats, she is addicted to these!  They aren't very chalky or too smelly and she enjoys the hard but soft enough texture for her big mouth/small teeth combo :)  These treats also don't leave any residue on the carpet which is very nice.\n",
      "I have 2 small dogs and buying this pack on Amazon saved a great deal of money! I was worried about them being outdated and dried out but I was wrong, I had one myself they were so fresh but for some reason now I have the urge to chase squirrels.\n",
      "My dog can't eat bully sticks or bones, so I have to find other treats.  She is also a bit overweight, so how can I beat Greenies Lite Treats?  The dog loves them and they are good for her teeth.  All around a perfect product.\n",
      "My dog loves these and it keeps him busy for 5 minutes which is a long time for my chew hound!\n",
      "My boxer likes these, but he doesn't get really excited about them.  But if they work as advertised and clean his teeth, then they are great.\n",
      "My dogs like this a lot. They are willing to do any tricks for this. They have it for over three years and still love it.\n",
      "As with any dog treat, you must monitor your pet while consuming but Greenies are the best! My dogs know exactly when it is Greenie Time!\n",
      "I have a 6 pound toy poodle and she would be very depressed without her daily ration of greenies.  She knows that after supper she receives her greenie and she loves them.  It is the one thing that I can depend on her eating.  Since we do feed a lot of soft food, the greenie helps clean her teeth.  The price on these greenies is very good and they were fresh and came in a timely manner.\n",
      "I LIKE GREENIES, MY DOGS LOVE GREENIES, AND GREENIES ARE A HEALTHY TREAT FOR MY PETS.  I HAVE BEEN BUYING GREENIES FOR FOUR YEARS.  I DID NOT KNOW THAT AMAZON SOLD GREENIEN UNTIL RECENTLY.\n",
      "These things are awesome.  These Greenies really clean your dog's teeth very well.  When I first opened the container I was a bit skeptical because they smelled pretty bad but after a week of using these.  My dogs breath was great, and I used to not be able to bear her breath.  It's a must buy for any pet owner.\n",

      "Updates: One Day, One Week, Two Weeks, One Month, Three Months, Six Months<br /><br />One Day<br />-------<br />Ordered these yesterday and they came in today, even with Prime two-day shipping - Thanks Amazon!  I gave one to my dachshund, a short-haired 25-lb ball of energy, and he loved it.  He's 10 years old and had typical dog breath.  I'm hoping that giving these to him will not only make his breath less stinky, but also (and more importantly) help out with his teeth.  Whenever he yawns or opens his mouth wide, I can see some plaque on his rear teeth.  The vet hasn't said anything bad about that when I've brought it up, but he no longer rips on his rope toys like he used to.  Sure, some of his loss of love for tug of war can be attributed to age, but I think maybe his teeth are a bit weaker too.  I'll update this according to the schedule I laid out at the very top and let you know what happens.  I've also seen lots of reviews online (not about this product, but about dog- and pet-food in general) being made out of sub par or even unhealthy materials.  I'll let you know if my dog's behavior or overall health changes as well.<br /><br />One Week<br />-------<br />My dog is still loving these things.  I feed him in the morning so I like to think these are an evening snack for him.  I don't know what exactly the dental chews are made from, but I'm able to bend the little green toothbrush-shaped chews into a \"U\" and they don't seem to break.  Perhaps it's some kind of gel or gummy chew?  His breath seems a little less \"heavy\".  His teeth seem to be the same. His behavior hasn't changed either, other than being extremely excited to get a chew at night.  This last bit is important to me, because I know some dog treats can be more like dog-crack!<br />See you in a week!<br /><br />Eventually<br />--------<br />Sorry I didn't keep up to my schedule - I think these things work, though not as well as I'd hoped.  My dog still has lots of plaque and buildup on his rear teeth and more disturbingly these things have caused my dog to frequently urinate in my house.  I suspect they are making him drink a lot of water which he can't hold in.  I walk him three times a day and put him outside two to three more times so there's no issue on my end.<br />My ultimate conclusion is that these are just OK.  They aren't damaging to my dog's health... but to say they were helpful in improving his dental situation would be giving these too much credit.<br />My S&S shipments have been cancelled and I'm out looking for a better product.\n",
      "My pekingese loves these!She is known to be quite a picky eater,so I ordered the sample size( called a 'mini-treat pak' of the Greenies first to see if she'd like them.( I believe the sample size =22 of the 'Teenie' size). She ended up loving them,so I kept the small zip-lock pouch the sample size came in. I just take about 20 of the Greenies at a time from the large 96 chews container and refill the zip-lock pouch.*It also is a great way to bring some Greenies along with you when you are traveling with your dog!<br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JQCJIG\">Greenies Treats for Dogs (5-15 lbs/2-7 kg)Mini Treat-Pak-Teenie 6 oz</a>\n",
      "As soon as my dogs hear that I open the box they come running.  They absolutely love these chews! Don't know what it is, but they're irresistable to my dogs!\n",
      "I have three dogs.  They all loved the Greenies.  One dog does not chew her food, but gulps it whole.  I had to cut the Greenies into smaller portions for her.  It does help clean teeth, but caused diarrhea.  I think I'll look for another product for teeth cleaning.\n",
      "I buy these directly from amazon because they're always cheaper than I can find them at local pet stores. My dog goes absolutely crazy for the Greenies Lite. I'd originally started him off on the normal greenies but switched to the Lite about a year ago and he loves these just as much. I recently had to get the normal greenies because they were out of Lite and my dog wouldn't go near them; thank goodness I purchased the normal ones at a place where they took returns.<br /><br />I give my guy a few throughout the day as treats so I just bend and twist them in half; otherwise my dachshund/pekingese mix will demand more and at roughly $30 a box, I'd go broke if I gave him as many as he could eat. As long as the box is fresh, the greenies will be nice and bendable... I have purchased a box on a few occasions where the greenies were rock hard.<br /><br />My only complaint is the price. I just wish they were a tad lower. Even still, I will keep buying these as they're my dog's fave treats.\n",
      "Received the Greenies and immediately gave 1 to each of my dogs. Lola chewed hers right away and loved it. Lily hides hers and then eats it later. Nice size and good price. Both dogs enjoy Greenies.\n",
      "I order these constantly for my dogs, and my review is always the same:  Most dogs think they are the best thing since grass, and will do all kinds of tricks to get them.\n",
      "This is the best price for Greenies.  Greenies do a great job helping to keep my dog's teeth in their best shape.  So glad I discovered this product on Amazon as they are almost too expensive to buy anywhere else.\n",
      "Been buying greenies for years.  Decide to try the senior version but it made my dog sick.  I don't know if its to soft or what but it seemed to get stuck in his throat that he'd eat some grass to throw it up.  Bummed since I bought a tub.\n",
      "My two dachshunds love these things.  They know they are going to get one every morning.  They lead me to the pantry and are so cute when they beg or I call it talking, letting me know that they can't hardly wait.  Great product.\n",
      "Thank you so much for sending us this product that our dogs love so much! It was neatly packaged and enjoyed by the dogs the minute we opened the package. The deal is amazing!\n",
      "Our yorkie and shitzu love greenies and the price at amazon is significantly lower than what I can find at petsmart or Petco. I will continue to buy from Amazon\n",
      "Greenies are one of my English Bulldog's favorite treats.  They are a bit on the expensive side, but if you get them on Amazon instead of one of the large Pet stroe chains, you get a better deal.  I tried the Costco brand of dental chews (they were about half the price) and they disagreed with my dog's stomach so I came back to Greenies.  I usually break them in half and put it in is kong toy so it's like a puzzle for him to get it out.  If I just give it to him he eats it really quickly.  Overall, Greenies are a great product.\n",
      "I had to pay a fortune to have our dog's teeth cleaned. Plus it was a difficult thing for her...she got very upset and was in pain for a few days. So I started using Greenies, and wow...they have her scheduled for a teeth cleaning that I will cancel, because it has kept her teeth so clean. Best of all, though, she is a very picky eater. Most things that are supposedly flavored to please dogs do not please her. She just won't eat them, but Greenies for teeth...she can't wait to have them. I just ask her if she wants to brush her teeth, and she is ready and waiting. The other night I got out her pills to give her for arthritis and made the mistake of getting out the greenie at the same time. She didn't want the pills although they were covered in peanut butter, which she usually loves. Once she finished the greenie, she wanted the \"peanut butter pills.\"\n",
      "Greenies are great dental chews that keep my dog with minimal plaque.<br />My 3 yr old loves it.<br />The price of the 96 Teenie Pack (or more) from Amazon is unbeatable.<br /><br />Of note, my dog didn't like it very much when he tried it the first time when he was 2 months old. He grew to love it more and more. So don't give up and give it to someone else if your puppy is not crazy about them from the first day.\n",
      "My dog loves em. This is cheapest you will find these anywhere! This is my second time ordering great deal!\n",
      "Keeps the dog's teeth nice and white. Smells like it is filled with minerals and all kinds of good stuff. Highly recommended by vets. Works well for us.\n",
      "This product is great, you get as many treats with the teenies as the Petite size and my puppies love them like crazy. The price is great, delivery service was great, overall happy with everything\n",
      "Shipped very fast.  Great product for your dog's teeth.  I have been giving my poodle greenies ofr years now and my vet said that her teeth are just as white and healthy as a 2 year old dogs.  She is 10 years old.\n",
      "I buy Greenies frequently for my dogs. They love them. I buy them for my \"granddogs' also. Very good product.\n",
      "I have used these little treats for our 2 dogs for a while and never had a problem.  This time the container arrived a little dented and when I opened it, discovered that the inside pouch had been damaged and the greenies are stuck together.  Disappointing.\n",
      "My dog is not wild about many treats but she loves Greenies.  She just can't resist them.  She never eats the cat's food, but once I had some cat Greenies in the bowl and she scarffed them up!  The only reason I gave them 4 stars is that I wish they weren't so expensive.\n",
      "Our dogs adore these and they are usually fairly pricey for the amount you get. However Amazon always has one great deal or another for buying these and significantly cheaper than in store prices.<br /><br />We usually buy the 130 or 96 pack of 'Teenies' for our two chihuahua mix dogs (depending whichever has the better sale price at the time.<br /><br />The teenie size is great for our smaller dog (6lb) as he can fully chew on it and savor it. However it is not quite enough for our other chihuahua mix (13lb) she tends to gulp it down like any other dog treat without getting as much benefit from the dental cleaning that Greenies are supposed to help with. Now that she is a little larger (she loved these as a pup) I think we may 'graduate' her to the next size of Greenie.<br /><br />I have always found that our dogs look forward to their Greenie treats and see them as a special treat which is great because keeping a dogs dental health in check is important and I find Greenies do help with this and yet are delicious to the dog.<br /><br />Our larger dog has been given Greenies for two years now and her teeth are still almost entirely stain free and her breath is not as bad as some dogs. However I would not use Greenies solely to keep a dogs breath in check, I recommend getting some other product for that.\n",
      "Well, they are Greenies.  Not much else to say about them besides it's a fantastic price.  They come in the green box shown, but inside is a re-sealable bag to keep them fresh which was really nice and actually a concern I had when I first purchased them.\n",
      "My dogs love these greenies. Their teeth are super white from chewing on them and their breath somehow is no longer as stinky. The only thing is that they are a tad-overpriced, so I recommend buying them in bulk if you are truly satisfied with this product like I am.\n",
      "My dogs go crazy for these!! I was worried for their safety since I had heard some negative reviews for these chews, so I did some research and found that the most common problem is from choking.  They do chomp them down so I have them eat it while I'm nearby in case they choke (haven't yet).  Their teeth and gums are clean and strong so that saves $$ on dental bills.  I don't like the idea of having them go under general anesthesia just to get their teeth cleaned (seems much riskier), so I will continue to take the \"risk\" with Greenies. Amazon price for these, even with shipping costs, are still the lowest. And my dogs get to bark at the FedEx guy!!\n",
      "These do help to keep my dogs teeth clean and they are just the right size for my 7 lb chihuahua. Much, much better value on Amazon then your local pet supply warehouse.\n",
      "My dogs love these treats! When my dogs wake up in the morning thats the first thing they want to eat! Especially my dog Luna cries for one. When I say greenie, she immediately runs downstairs and sit right in front of the pantry for one. I highly recommend these treats!\n",
      "I have a 10 month old puppy. She is a mix between 1/4 poodle, chihuahua, terrier, and maltese. She is SUPER picky with treats and food in general and she absolutely loves these!! She wants one all the time! Her bowel movements are not affected by them in a negative way. The only thing I would say that is a con is that they don't last very long! She eats them pretty quickly even though the material of them is pretty rock solid and her mouth is tiny.\n",
      "I have two dogs and they both love this it. I've been giving them this treat for over a year now and had no issues. The only reason why I give it a 4 star instead of a 5 is because it does not help my dogs with their minor tartar build up like it's supposed to. Other than that, it's a great treat.\n",
      "I give these little dental toothbrush treats to my three Yorkies and they scatter to all corners to protect and eat their treats. Small dogs often have dental problems and I use these to help their teeth!  They are the perfect size for my dogs.\n",
      "I don't know what it is about them, but dogs will listen to you if you're offering one of these as a reward. My dog gets one every night, after she performs a few tricks flawlessly knowling the reward is one of these.\n",
      "Our 13 year old minature fox terrier loves them and they take a nice amount of time for her to devour.\n",
      "Good for dogs with sensitive stomachs and tasty too!  Also very healthy / great guaranteed analysis.  Am already on my second box of 96 Teeny's!\n",
      "LOVE the Greenies.....my rat terriers favorite snack!  Just say the word and they come running!  Enjoy them and don't forget to buy more!!\n",
      "As usual it's great, I get a lot of compliment about my black lab very white teeth ! I just wish they would make bigger boxes, the large greenies come only at a maximum of 17 a box.\n",
      "The shipment came on time and was packed perfectly.  My dogs get two greenies daily, their teeth have less plaque and their breaths are pleasant  I love this product!\n",
      "I got these for the \"health\" benefits of fresh breath, plaque and overall quality of stuff. I like to treat my kids now and again and they love them so much they have even taken to identifying these treats as \"greenies\"! Yes I know it is typically the tone but they even get excited if you say the word green now, its crazy. So I'd say, get these for your kids they will love them so much you'll have a hard time denying them at least one a day. I know I do.\n",
      "I have a one year old Pomeranian whom has been on greenies since she was about 3mos. Let me tell you, I've gone to the vet several times during her first year for different reasons. The first time her vet was happy to see that she had a healthy \"smile\" and hoped it continued, she was still a puppy. Since then, we moved to another city and she now has a different vet. This vet was so excited, and YES i said EXCITED, to see my fur baby's gums and teeth. The vet asked to take a picture of Foxy's(my fur baby) teeth to post on their website. She asked me if i brush them daily. I said nope, we've been using greenies does that count?? She said YES and added, in detail, how healthy it is for them in A LOT of aspects. Buying them from a pet store is ridiculous to me because the price for a pack of 20 is over $19. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?! So when i saw this price and the amt that come in the pack, I've been buying them on here ever since!! I give them to her once a day EVERYDAY at 9pm. She even recognizes the word \"greenies\" and follows me to the pantry when it's that time of day for her. Because of a previous review i read about storing them in the container it comes in for a while caused maggots, i got really grossed out(has NEVER happened to me) so JUST IN CASE, i dump them in a snap seal, clear, plastic container.\n",
      "Excellent healthy product for your small dogs!  Please be aware that you must watch your pup when giving them this small greenie or they will swallow the entire thing in one gulp!!  Quick Service by the Seller and Excellent Price for this product!  I will purchase more for sure!!\n",
      "These were sold on here for much cheaper than I could find in stores, and I am very happy with how they helped my dog's breath. These are small, probably good for dogs 10 lbs or less.\n",
      "My dog Lexie loves these things she gets one everynight at 7 and she let's us know if we are late with it\n",
      "I have a bichon beagle hybrid mix (called a glechon).  He just loves greenies. We just had him into his vet for his checkup and the vet told us that his teeth were beautiful. He wanted to know what we did to keep them that way. The only thing we do is to give him greenies. I've had two other people comment on his teeth in the past month. I highly recommend these treats for your dog if you want him to have good teeth and breath. We've never had trouble with him being able to digest them. They are a little costly but I feel they're well worth the extra cost.\n",
      "My dog loves these treats and the 96 count box is the best deal. They come in a foil package in the box so they stay fresh till the last one.\n",
      "I read the reviews and decided to purchase Greenies for my two dogs.  Unfortunately, neither one will eat them.  I gave one box to my son and one to my daughter and thier dogs love them.  Go figure.\n",
      "One of these at night, is my Yorkie's toothbrush & breath mint. He is almost ten, and loves his Greenies.\n",
      "My dog and I both love this product.  My vet even said it was great that my dog is having one every day.  I feed my dog homemade dog food which includes sardines, so Greenies are a necessity.<br />Don't know what we would do without them.\n",
      "My two dogs adore Greenies!  This seemed to be the best place & price I found online.  Very quickly shipped too.\n",
      "I purchased some Greenies Regular pack of 27 which I think is a great deal and it was delivered promptly.  But there is extra packaging which needs to be recycled.\n",
      "My dog's morning just wouldn't be complete without her Greenie! I think it's the minty scent that drives her crazy but she loves them. She's @18 lb so the Teenies are just right for her.\n",
      "It's reassuring that the treats I give my precious Yorkie are of the best quality and of course I appreciate the cost effectiveness of dealing with a reputable company.  Amazon has provided swift service and a product that would cost much more from a local pet shop.  Greenies are good for my dog's dental health and are not dangerous as are rawhides or toys with squeeking mechanisms which can choke a dog.  Just the sight of the Greenie box, and she knows it's nap time or time for a treat.\n",
      "It's so wonderful not to have to pay the high prices at PetSmart for these Greenies.  My pups LOVE them!!\n",
      "THESE ARE THE BEST DENTAL TREATS ON THE MARKET!  MY CHIWEENIE THINKS THESE ARE THE BEST INVENTION SINCE MEAT.  LOL.  HER DAY IS NOT STARTED UNTIL SHE HAS ONE, THEN SHE EATS, BUT NEVER EATS FIRST!\n",
      "My two dogs (Pugs) absolutely love these.  They get one every night and they have excellent dental health.  Amazon has the absolute best price over retail.\n",
      "My puppy loves this product.  The moment he has a Greenie in his mouth, he'll begin to munch.  I actually got this product not only to keep my pup's teeth clean, but am using it to help my puppy teeth.  The product is just hard enough so that my puppy can keep gnawing on it, but it is simultaneously soft enough for him to sink his teeth into (providing assistance for teeth development).  I definitely recommend this product.\n",
      "My veterinarian recommended these.  My dog is a German Shepherd, Pit Bull, Jack Russel mix.  His top part is huge but his legs- not so much.  Basically he needs his weight managed all the time because we don't want knee problems to develop.  At his last trip Dr. Kragness said he had a bit of a tartar problem (organic food related) and to try a greenie a day.  Well he's been chewing them for about 12 days and his teeth look great and as an added benefit his breath is clean, still hot but clean smelling.  In addition I've noticed that he doesn't have a lot of doggy gas like usual.  I thought the price was a bit steep but tried them on the word of the vet and for the obvious results we're getting I guess you get what you pay for here.\n",
      "My doggie loves Greenies she will not go to bed without her Greenie. They are digestible helps clean teeth. They are a bit expensive but they are a good product and I would and do recommend them.\n",
      "These are the only treats I can get my dog to eat. She has to be limited as she will make a meal on these if I would let her.\n",
      "Greenies dental chews are a product that my dogs love to eat.  Around 6:30-7:00 my dogs start to bark, jump up, follow me everywhere because it's time for their Greenies.  Best thing I ever got for them.\n",
      "I have an 11 year old Jack Russle who's teeth have worn down over the years. Greenies are great for him as they are not hard for him to chew and he LOVES them. Every evening all I have to say is \"Want your Greenie\"? And he comes running. It's the only dog treat he eats now.\n",
      "My corgi loves these greenies!  I like it how the greenies come in a zippable bag inside the cardboard box!  I have the choice of throwing out the bag and using the box or vice versa!<br /><br />I chose the free shipping method.  It took awhile to ship, but once shipped, it came in a timely manner.\n",
      "My pug loves his \"Toothbrushes.\"  THey help keep away dog breath, and I don't see a lot of plaque build up on his teeth.\n",
      "My dog thinks these are wonderful.<br />I think Amazon's price for them is wonderful.<br />It's not difficult to find other dog owners who would be willing to split a box, so I'm not worried about brittleness.<br />Win-Win\n",
      "my yorkies love these things. I have a 3 pounder and an 11 pounder and they think getting these are the bees knees! i tried the other sizes but i think since these just fit right in their mouth they love it. The product has a really over bearing smell but once you get over that (it is a dog treat) its amazing\n",
      "I am so happy with the deal I got on these Greenies.  My dogs are even happier.  House full of happy campers with these here.\n",
      "Came with the plastic bin! My Lhasa Apso liked at first but tired of it a couple weeks later. Bummer. So I gave away. She prefers natural chicken jerky now..\n",
      "My dog has been loving these chews for years! I give him one everyday and it has done a great job at keeping plaque and tartar build up at bay.\n",
      "My dog is in love with these treats. He comes running when I say, \"Do you want a greeny?\" Then he takes it under the bed to devour it. My dog's teeth and breath stay healthy due to his greenies in between brushings. Nice to get such a big box at this great price.\n",
      "My dog loooves these treats. He's a 50 lb Rhodesian Ridgeback mutt and devours these! I'm not sure about the dental impact yet as he's only had them for 2 weeks or so. But this combined with toothpaste would be more effective.\n",
      "I have a pitbull who loves her treats I'm obsessed with keeping her healthy so these work great on her teeth and they're a great price!\n",
      "I was kinda skeptic about this green chews. Turned out my dogs love it very much.<br />Had purchased my 5th boxes, and worked well on preventing teeth decay. Very satisfied and will keep restock.\n",
      "Our labradoodle likes his Greenies.  The product seems to be helping with the plaque problem he's been having.  It is a bit costly for continual use.\n",
      "Bob loves these treats better than anything and lets me know every day when it's Greenie Time.  I cut them in half because they are so expensive but I've been able to find them at much better prices on Amazon than in the pet food stores even with the manufacturer's infrequent coupon.  If your dog loves these, buy them online and save.\n",
      "My dog loves these treats.  I can comb her or cut the wads of hair under her ears when she is eating one of these.  Otherwise forget it.  She is still young, so I hope I will get her to sit still while I groom her, but for now my puppy and I love these.  The shipper was great too.\n",
      "The price is rite!!! this is the second time I bought them, dogs love them!!! will bye some more!!! thats about it.\n",
      "My dogs love the Greenies taste. They prefer Greenies to any of their other treats. They've been chewing Greenies for 5 yrs, and have not had to have their teeth cleaned.\n",
      "I like to buy Greenies for my dog but they are very expensive even in multi-packs. If you purchase at online pet stores they are somewhat less expensive but not like the boxes offered on Amazon.  Dogs need clean teeth and healthy gums and Greenies will take care of both.  Easily digestible for my 13 year old Shi-Tzu.\n",
      "About two years ago I adopted a little toy poodle from my local humane society.  She had been rescued from a puppy mill and was underweight, coated in fleas and had a broken jaw.  After trying to fix the jaw with a metal plate and it getting infected, we ended up having her lower left jaw along with all of her teeth on that sound of her mouth removed completely.  A year later, during her annual dental cleaning she had 6 more teeth removed and is now down to about 8 total.  Shortly after I discovered Greenies.  Everyday I come home from work and after she is done going outside, she sits by the pantry door waiting for her Greenie.  When I open the door to the pantry she starts \"dancing\" on her two back legs.  The last time I took her into the vet, they said she only had Grade 1 Dental Disease as opposed to the Grade 3 the year before -  Thank you Greenies for creating a delicious product that is helping to save my dog's few precious teeth!  Thank you Amazon for offering them at an affordable price with free shipping!\n",
      "We bought these for our 65 lb golden retriever. He is not a powerful chewer since he has a retriever's mouth, but he is a diligent chewer. He'll chew and keep chewing once he gets going. The size of the large-sized Greenies seems right for him.<br /><br />Our dog's breath was getting stinky and we were noticing some buildup of plaque, so we got the Greenies Dental Treats. He simply loves these. But he eats them a little to fast. They only last a few minutes. I wish he would chew more and swallow less!<br /><br />But our dogs breath does seem better. We don't use them every day, more like every other day to make them last, but they still seem to do some decent teeth cleaning. I would use these in combination with other teeth/gum health products like the Nylabones and raw hides.\n",
      "This is a fantastic deal!! My dogs love greenies but at over $20 per bag at the local pet supply store, I couldn't afford to give them one everyday. I order these again and again.\n",
      "Our little guy eats one of these a day after dinner.  he sits and waits until they are given. A super price for the box and fast shipping. Will definately order again.\n",
      "Any edible bone can cause a dog to choke, but Greenies changed their formula about a year ago to make it more digestible.  I love the product.\n",
      "My Pug puppies absolutely love these bones.  The only negative aspect is that they get sticky & leave a green film that dries to a green crust on their front legs & paws (& whatever they're laying on, usually the sofa!)  Long after the bone has been chewed to a little nub & swallowed, my beautiful girls are licking their paws & staring at me, begging for another with their big, sad eyes.  Even though my puppies are only 12 lbs & just under 8 months old, I give them the regular size.  The smaller ones just don't last long enough with my power chewers.  I usually try to wrestle the small end from my girls before they get swallowed, as I do with EVERY treat they get, but I'm rarely successful.  They have the habit of swallowing pieces that seem far too large for them, but I've never had a problem with these bones.  I've never had any pieces reappear later (in any form) or had any blockage or choking problems.  I'm fully convinced that the bones dissolve quickly & safely in their tummies.<br />A lot of people have negative things to say about these treats, even our vet has a note about these specific bones causing \"digestive upset\" on his website, but I have had nothing but wonderful experiences (since purchasing washable slipcovers for our furniture!)<br />If you're worried about trying these treats, I'd suggest giving a larger size than is called for & observing your fur-child like any good parent should.<br /><br />Common sense for all pet owners:  Take the end of any treat away before it can be swallowed.  If you haven't already, ask your vet to teach you the doggie heimlich maneuver & doggie CPR, just in case.\n",
      "We have tried other chew products for our dog and these are by far her favorite. They don't get messy like other chew treats and her breath smells so much better, even better than the dental milkbones out there. She really does prefer these over any other dog treat.\n",
      "Received the Petite Lite Greenies 27 oz box today.  The picture shows a count of 96 bones, but I only got a box of 45.  I realize that the picture shows the Teenie size w/96 and 27oz, so naturally the next size up Petite would have fewer bones, but I think receiving only 45 is a bit deceiving.  45 bones for almost $25 isn't bad, but I won't be purchasing on a regular basis.  These are for a Christmas gift, so they are a splurge anyway!  My dogs, a Chihuahua, MinPin and Shichon love them!\n",
      "My son brought these home one day for our 12 year old Cocker Spaniel. She became 'hooked' on them rather quickly and starts howling for them around 7:00pm daily. Amazon pricing is significantly less than the local stores and Prime delivery is incredibly convenient.\n",
      "We bought these as a Christmas present for my dog, and he just loves them!  A little pricey, but he's worth it.\n",
      "All greenies are overpriced.  But, since my critters love 'em so, I watch the price and get a bunch when it drops to a more reasonable level.  Still too high, but.....<br /><br />Since I'm buying something, I think is way overpriced...  yet I still buy it, should say it all.  My gang loves the darn things.  I prefer tendons or pizzles, since they last awhile.  But, they love Greenies.  So, I get em.<br /><br />You probably will too...  we got our pets, right where THEY want us......\n",
      "Of all the dog teeth treats, I bought this one because it was highly recommended by doggie dentists. If your dog doesn't take to it right away, have some patience. My own dog took it in strides at first--she would chew on it but not swallow it. And now she looks forward to it more than any other little treat. I don't know what it does for her breath (which is never very minty fresh), but her teeth are sparkling white. Giving her one a day doesn't make her stomach hurt in any way.\n",
      "Our dogs have only been chewing these for about a week and a half and they are great for freshening their breath!!! Their breath was so bad that you couldn't stand having them breathe anywhere by you, now their breath is alot better. I think that it is only gonna continue to get better :) Plus they love them and these don't upset their sensitive tummies!!!! I would recommend these to anyone :)\n",
      "\"I love them\"<br /><br />  - Winston the dog<br /><br />\"These are delicious\"<br /><br />  - Suzi the dog<br /><br />\"feh....not a reasonable substitute for tunafish\"<br /><br />  - Peke the cat\n",
      "I've been giving my dogs Greenies for years now.  Their excitement at receiving this treat never abates.  As expensive as they are, I feel my animals are well worth it.  This is doggie health food at its finest.  And the price here on Amazon is the best I've found to date.  However, I am completely disgusted with the packaging of this product.  The huge box is wasteful and not at all environmentally sound.  Come on Greenies people - put the product in a pouch and call it a day.\n",
      "My chihuahua and pomeranian get so excited when I bring out the teenie dental chews after their meal--I hope these are always in stock as I buy them frequently. It does seems to help reduce the tartar on their teeth and it's exceptionally high in protein unlike other treats.\n",
      "I tried these on the recommendation of our veterinarian for my 2 little dogs' bad breath. I didn't think they would like them, since the treat is hard & they favor soft treats. But both dogs love them! Within 2 days, their breath was improving. Now, they get their once a day treat to keep their breath smelling fresh.\n",
      "Our pups go nutty when we break out the Greenies.  They can hardly perform their requested tasks for the treats because they're just too excited.  They're a bit expensive for our budget right now, but when we can afford it, we really like to get these for them.  Keeps their breath very clean-smelling and they really just... love love love their Greenies!\n",
      "My poodle loves greenies!  We joke that they're like crack to her.  She demands one every night at 8 pm.  I can't complain too much though - her breath is great!\n",
      "This is the third  ontainer we have purchased and as a once a day treat the dogs love them. All have learned to sit and beg after each morning outing.  Try them for your dog!  Good value for your money as I use the 96 pack.\n",
      "My Italian greyhound LOVES these treats, and I've yet to notice any problems as described by so many other reviewers. My Bella (her name) gets one of these treats about every other day since she's very difficult when it comes to me actually brushing her teeth. They definitely do the job.<br /><br />Some people have stated that their dog has choked on these treats or a piece got caught in their intestinal track. Well, I'm not sure how fast your dog tends to eat treats, or how big of a chunk they try to bite off, but that DOES matter when it comes to digestion of anything. My pup eats these treats pretty slowly (as I think she realizes it lasts longer that way), and I make sure I'm in the room while she's eating it. She'll chew off small pieces to eat, not large ones so I'm not sure if that makes a difference but I assume it would.<br /><br />I also make sure she gets plenty of water afterwards, to wash it down. The person at Petsmart told me these are like crack for dogs. While I can believe that, my iggy has several different types of treats and only gets this one every other day. If I gave her this for everything, I could see it becoming an issue.<br /><br />Overall, I think these are great, they help to keep my dogs mouth clean so that I'm not having to brush her teeth quite as much.\n",
      "You won't be able to over sleep if your dog gets hooked on these dental chews.  One is enough, but your dog will drive you crazy until you get up and offer him this special way to start his day.\n",
      "One greenie a day after dinner helps our dog's teeth stay cleaner.  Also we brush daily with the salmon oil infused grain alcohol gel product.  That works so much better than the enzymatic toothpastes.\n",
      "Got these large Greenies originally when we noticed our 60+lb Boxer mix puppies' teeth were getting a little dirty and brushing didn't too much.  We give them each one Greenie in the morning when we leave for work, they love them.  The boy gobbles it down, but his sister savors every bit.  They also keep the buildup on their teeth down quite a bit, they're not going to make them shine, but they'll keep them pretty clean!\n",
      "Molly and Cocoa, our cocker spaniels, said to tell you that they love these greenies and can't think of anything they would rather munch on.  They have sizes just right for them, are easy to chew and easy to digest.  The fact that they come in \"lite\" is a bonus as it helps us keep their calorie content down in the winter when they don't get as much exercise.  I would highly recommend greenies for a great treat that helps clean dog's teeth and eliminate bad breath.\n",
      "If your dogs go thru the shakes when you run out like mine do then you need to stock up. The cheapest price you will find delivered to your home. Better deal than you will ever get in a store.\n",
      "I have 2 fairly large dogs that need chew treats to help clean their teeth, but they are very picky and reject most of this type of treats.  They love these, though, and by purchasing the Tub Pack, I save a lot in comparison to the other possibilities.\n",
      "I have a 12 pound, 18 month old couton.  He would rate these as 5 stars.<br /><br />The problem is, he finishes these off in 5 minutes.<br /><br />This makes it an expensive dog biscuit, rather than a dental chew toy.\n",
      "My dog seems to know when it about noon and time to \"brush his teeth!\" He does vertical jumps until that little green toothbrush comes out of the container!\n",
      "Greenies lite treats tub pak is the way to go for my dog, she always looks forward to one of these before she goes to bed.\n",
      "I buy the lite teenies for my two little dogs and they are just right for treats.  My dogs will do anything to get these.\n",
      "My dog loves Greenies! Read some reviews about it online and tried it out since Amazon Prime shipping is free, the price was affordable, and my dog refuses to have his teeth brushed. I've been giving him 1 per day for a few days now and it's like a treat to him! I'm satisfied. :-)\n",
      "I have an Old English Sheepdog puppy who was developing inflamed gums and awful dog breath way younger than he should have been.  I started feeding him these, and within a very short time (weeks?  Maybe even less), the inflammation had gone away and his breath was much better.  I buy a size smaller than recommended for his size, and that way he can have more than one -- it breaks the treat up.  Since he loves these, I can use them as a reward.  Next box, I'm going to buy an even smaller size so I can divide the treat up even more throughout the day.\n",
      "I have two Peek-a-Poo's and just say Greenies and they go crazy.  These are the reformulated Greenies are made with gelatin compared to the old ones that had harmed some dogs and were pulled from market.  These are easily digested as I started them out slow and made sure they chewed and not swallowed them, which could be harmful. I trust Amazon to sell me items that will not cause harm.  I personally thoroughly check for anything foreign which is due to the manufacturer and not Amazon.\n",
      "When we adopted our 6 year old Basset Hound from a foster home, her back teeth had so much build up that they were actually brown.  Now after four months, they are not completely back, but they are about 75% better. Although they are not inexpensive, I think they do a good job.  And she also enjoys them very much.  I have checked many places and have found Amazons prices to be the best so far.\n",
      "This item came from the shipper quick and as described.  my dog LOVES greenies- and they really do seem to keep his teeth and breath clean.\n",
      "I have two dogs, 22 pounds and 45 pounds. Got the large size which is supposed to be for 50-100 lbs. My dogs love these things. I mean within a few short minutes they are gone. I thought they would be a little more of a challenge. I guess the big question is are they in my dogs mouth long enough to actually do any teeth cleaning? Or are they just a delicious treat for my dogs to enjoy?\n",
      "Our old dog has dental problems and arthritis.  She LOVES her Greenies and reminds us that she \"deserves\" one a day.  Since starting on her \"senior\" Greenies, she is much more limber and agile.  She has also started chewing on her chew sticks again (after several years of not being interested in them...and yes, we take her to the vet to have her teeth cleaned).\n",
      "Our Cocker Spaniel is spoiled on all kinds of treats including table leftovers but she always has room for a Greenie.  Her dental hygene is also important to us and the Greenies seem to do the job.\n",
      "Greenies were at a super price!!! Great packaging, prompt delivery. Our dogs love them. Great doing business with this site. Will look here next time I want to order this item!!!\n",
      "Our three dogs love Greenies. They are very expensive (usually $32.99, but marked down to $29.99 sometimes). Then, on top of that you have state tax. So ... if I buy 4 boxes: two Petite and two Teenies in a store that has \"Pet\" as part of the name, it'll cost me over $135.00. If I do the same thing through Amazon companies prices it costs me about $85.00. That's a difference of $50.00 (for the Math impaired reader ...). Go with free shipping because it, literally, gets here the same time frame. Use the $50.00 and take your spouse out to dinner!<br />The product is great. I did notice that two in the same day was a bit tough on my Pomeranian's digestive system and caused a little diarrhea. The dogs love the taste and would eat them all the time. We get the small ones despite having two larger dogs because they will chomp them down in a heartbeat. With the smaller sizes the dogs still get a treat and the boxes have a lot larger amount of Greenies in them.\n",
      "What a price for a product I always buy for my dog. Thanks so much Amazon! I will be back to buy more Greenies!\n",
      "No complaints. My dogs both enjoy them and they have nice breathe afterwards. My dogs are 10 pounds each and I got the Teenies. They are very chewy so it takes a bit for my dogs to eat them, but I think that is part of the fun for them. Highly recommend!\n",
      "These are great treats for dogs. My bichon is 14 pounds but this is a good size treat for her and the fact that they promote dental health is a bonus.\n",
      "I have used them for years.  My dog can't wait to get one each morning. She does a \"Greenie Dance\".  She jumps around and wiil do about anything to get the Greenie.  This was the first time I ordered them on amazon and I'm glad I did.  I got the lowest price ever and they were delivered the fastest.\n",
      "All dogs love these treats/chews! It does keep both of my dogs' teeth cleaned and they love it! They know that when I get home from work every night, they get a treat and they are so excited. I highly recommend these :) Plus they are much cheaper on Amazon.com, than at your local Petsmart or PetCo.\n",
      "When my dogs see me reaching for the Greenie box they immediately sit on their bottoms and behave wonderfully. One of the dogs will even do a little dance when we finally give her the treat. We give our dogs one greenie about every other day and they just love them. They take a lot of time in carefully chewing the greenie, so it doesn't appear they are swallowing them too quickly. I usually get the Petite or Teeny varieties for our two 10 lb dogs, but since they like them so much I moved to regular. Hopefully I'll see a change in their breath soon as they hate getting their teeth brushed.\n",
      "While they are expensive Greenies do the trick for a dogs dental health. We tried a couple other brands and went back to these. The price on Amazon cant be beat. Dog is happy as well and gets excited whenever anyone says Greenie! His breath is so much better after just a day or two of use.\n",
      "we brush our dogs teeth in the morning and feed once a day at evening time so we give him a Greenie after he eats to clean up his teeth and breath because we give him Sardine oil with his meal and this works great \"no fish breath\".  He loves the Greenies.\n",
      "When my toy poodle finishes her dog food-she comes to me and barks and barks for her treat, GREENIES.She will not stop barking till she gets it.  I make sure she has eaten her dog food then she gets her GREENIE. It is the highlight of her day,and she is the happiest dog. Her teeth are very white and she has the sweetest smelling breath.I make sure I am never out of GREENIES.The price is the greatest too.Thank you.D>D>\n",
      "Got the teenie greenies for my 16 1/2lb Shih Tzu- Lhasa Apso.  The package says that these are for dogs that range 5-15lbs, but I ordered them anyway (trying to save some money).  She loves them.  Gobbles them up straight away.<br /><br />Only advice-Stick to the poundage recommendation.  These treats are so small that I doubt my dog is getting the benefits of tartar control/removal.  On the bright side, she likes the taste, so they certainly work as regular daily treats.\n",
      "My dog loves these things, and I love that you can get almost 100 for about $20, if you went to a pet store you'd be paying at least twice as much for these things.  I have a Yorkie, and I only give these to her every so often (I try to remember to give one every other day so she doesn't get fatter).  I really hope that Amazon keeps them this cheap and I'll keep buying them\n",
      "[[ASIN:B000KBFKIQ Greenies Dental Chews for Dogs, Petite Pack, 45 Chews<br /> are not only great for Dogs teeth ~ but they must taste great.. I have a great dog who knows exactly when it is 5:00PM and has a particular bark for her Greenie. She is spoiled, so she also knows when it is 7:30PM and time for her second treat and barks that same bark for her second one.<br /><br />The vet did say that her teeth look great !!\n",
      "These bones are great!  Each one of my 22 chihuahuas love these bones.  I'm hoping they will help with their breath but even if they don't, it's still a great product for my chi's since they enjoy them so much.\n",
      "We have 4 very spoiled furbabies & Greenies are their \"special\" treat.  They each get a greenie when they are groomed, brushed, bathed, etc.  Just say the word Greenie & you have a flash mob of doggies begging energeticly at your feet.\n",
      "My little dog loves Greenies chews! We were first introduced to this dental treat at our vet's office and seeing how much Toby loved them I decided to start buying them for him. Imagine how surprised I was finding out the price at the pet store! When I saw this fabulous deal on Amazon for 96 Greenies I was thrilled. This will be Toby's favorite present under the tree for certain. As always, great fast service and even greater buys through Amazon.\n",
      "I have no idea what is in these but my wire hair terrier goes wild when the box comes out.  My daughter started me on these and he just loves them.  Had to get the small chew so he does not get fat on them as they are loaded with calories.  Checked with my vet and they had no problem with them, use for own dogs.  Only problem is once you start your dog on these it will be a continuous treat and even from Amazon these are not cheap.  As quickly as they are devoured the per minute price is astronomical.  But it is hard to deprive a dog you love of such a tasty treat!\n",
      "My dog loves these dental chews and they work well to keep most of the plaque off her teeth.  That saves on the vet bill.\n",
      "It is hard to find Greenies at a good price. This was the best price that i have found recently. My dog loves Greenies.\n",
      "I bought this product because I had a coupon it was a little expensive but I give one a week to my dog.  My dog loves them and if she could speak she would say please give me one a day.\n",
      "We started giving these to our dog to avoid having to have her teeth cleaned at a cost of 4 times human cleaning.  We'll see if it worked on our next vet appointment.\n",
      "My dog loves these treats and they help with her aging dog breath.  These arrived fast and fresh. Two Paws Up!\n",
      "MY DOG LOVES THEM. SHE GETS THEM EVERY MORNING AFTER SHE GOES OUT. SHE WON'T SETTLE DOWN UNTIL AFTER SHE HAS ONE. SHE WON'T LET ME FORGET ABOUT THEM. SHE LOOKS FOWARD TO IT EVERY DAY.\n",
      "This is a great deal. So much cheaper than the pet store. My dog loves these and it helps her breath smell better. It used to be terrible but she has gotten better after eating these. I just wish they lasted longer for her as she can chew one up in about 2 minutes.\n",
      "My 11 year old dog loves greenies!  It's the best treat besides the smoked salmon he regularly gets.  The smell weird and the ingrediants are not that clean, but he's a fairly picky dog.\n",
      "My dog is relatively picky when it comes to treats, but she loves these. They don't do much to help her doggy breath, but maybe over time they will help.\n",
      "My dog is about 70lbs, 11 years old and diabetic. We couldn't completely cut her off from all treats once she became diabetic, so we needed something healthier. She loves Greenies and they're healthy enough for us to feel comfortable. Yeah, they are pricey but if you buy them on Amazon with the free shipping they are alot cheaper than buying them in stores! For all she gives us, the treats are still a bargain!\n",
      "or really my dog loves them.  When I have a busy day and I am too tired to brush her teeth, I just give her one of these instead and they do as they describe:  keep her teeth clean.  They are very soft and easy on her teeth but also rub the leftovers off to keep them clean.  I really recommend these to anybody who has a dog and they also make cat greenies which also work for my barn cats and they love them.\n",
      "Our dog, Wylie, begs for a Greenie first thing in the AM. He would eat them exclusively if we allowed it (only one a day is allowed)! Teeth look great, so far.\n",
      "MY DOG LOVES GREENIES!  THIS IS A GREAT PRICE!  BETTER PRICE THAN ALL THE PET STORES.  WILL REORDER FROM AMAZON AGAIN.\n",
      "My chihuahuas love their greenies.  If they don't get them by 6:30 p.m. they let me know.  It's part of their routine and they know it.\n",
      "My dog loves this treat. It helps clean his teeth daily since brushing is not an option because he dislikes it. I recommend watching your dog while he chews it to prevent choking!!!!!\n",
      "I don't know if they actually freshen Sugar's breath or not, but she really likes them!  And since she's the princess, she can have whatever she wants!\n",
      "Great bargain , Amazons price is at least $10 cheaper the petco & petsmart .Our Jack Russell loves his nightly greenie.  I know we should be brushing his teeth but he turns into a Tasmanian devil every time we try. I like to think the greenies are the reason for his white teeth + he doesn't have doggie breath.\n",
      "I have ordered Greenie's several times from this buyer and I am always pleased with the quality as well as the price. This large box costs almost $1 each at Petco and PetSmart.\n",
      "Greenies are great. I have 3 dogs who really love and 2 of them<br />the 2 yr old and the 4 yr old have beautiful clean teeth. I only<br />wish I had known about them when the 12 yr old was young.  They really<br />love them and its improves their breath\n",
      "I bought 5 boxes of greenies, 2 for my dog and 3 for my friend's dog and the dogs go crazy about greenies!\n",
      "Our dog loves them.  He is 35 lbs and the Regular size is perfect and it seems to help with his teeth.\n",
      "My dogs love these treats. I have 3 small dogs and they can't wait to get their morning dental treat. The younger dogs teeth are pretty white and I hope to keep them this way but my older dogs teeth have some tartar on them. I noticed the tartar has gone down quite a bit after a month of feeding him these treats. Hope his teeth keep getting better.\n",
      "My bog loves these dental chews more than any other treat I have ever given him.  As a bonus they seem to give my dog better smelling breath.  Just so that it doesn't take you by surprise, they will turn your dog's poop a darker shade because of the coloring.<br /><br />I highly recommend these.\n",
      "I haven't been using them long enough to see if they are keeping his teeth clean. I am optimistic though. Once he has finished all 96 I should be able to tell.<br />He gets one a day and really loves them.\n",
      "My dog's bad breath went away...but as for long term health effects I have no idea whether positive or negative. My dog likes them and they've been recommended to me by everyone around. Amazon tends to beat the box xstores by 5-7$ a box.\n",
      "my italian greyhounds loves these greenies for their teeth and have used them for several years as they are very prone to cavities. They are 8 years old now\n",
      "I've been giving these dental chews to my chihuahua mix daily when I leave for work in the morning. She absolutely loves them and looks forward to them. Before I started giving these to her, she would cry when I was leaving, but now she actually gets excited. They don't last too long, but they last long enough for me to leave without her noticing. And these big boxes last for months.\n",
      "These are the best doggie treats ever. My little dachshunds go crazy for these. If I forget to give them their morning greenies, they come looking for me in the house and leap in the air and whine until I get up and go to the cabinet and fetch them a greenie. They do a good job keeping their breath clean too.\n",
      "I have been feeding Greenies to my 9 year old Schipperke since she was old enough to eat them.  She loves them, her teeth are exceptionally clean which I attribute to having fed these to her all of these years.  My Boy Schipperke is now 6 and I have feed them to him also.  My Vet remarks every time I take them for appointments how clean their teeth are.  I also brush their teeth most nights so a combined effort and my dogs teeth have never needed to be cleaned which has saved their little bodies from the trauma of anesthesia. Feed the right size and ALWAYS watch your animal with any treat.\n",
      "Been using Greenies for a couple months.  I have a toy poodle with a sensitive stomach.  So far, no issue for her.<br /><br />And it is sooo nice, no more doggie breath for her.  I highly recommend the treat as long as your dog can tolerate.  Seems like it has helped with the tartar too which is what motivated me for the purchase.<br /><br />Thanks Greenies!!! :-)\n",
      "<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KEVF32\">Greenies Dental Chews for Dogs, Regular, Pack of 27</a> A great product at a great price. My dogs love them.\n",
      "These really whiten their teeth.<br />And the dogs love them.  Works great for my big dog.<br />The price is why they only get 4 stars.\n",
      "EDIT: I had been giving my dog a half of one of these every day, and he was having digestive issues with them. I stopped giving them to him and he recovered. I will have to lower my rating on these, even though he loves the taste.<br /><br />I have a havanese dog. He is very picky about treats and food. He LOVES these things. He goes crazy for them. He sometimes won't even eat his regular food (EVO Chicken small bites) because he wants one of these first. I'm not sure if they are actually helping his teeth though. His teeth are looking kind of gnarly and he is only 3. I don't mind the smell of these treats either.\n",
      "I shopped a little to find the best price for these treats for my dog. This was the best I found, and with free shipping, it was even better than going to the petstores in my neighborhood!\n",
      "After doing an extensive price comparison we ended up purchasing a double pack from Amazon. So pleased with the Greenies product! Took one of our dogs for his annual exam yesterday and the doctor mentioned TWICE how good our boy's teeth look! YAY!\n",
      "A friends told me how much her dogs love Greenies. I was skeptical, a dog loves Any treat but i decided to buy some to give my dogs and I am sold, they just LOVE Greenies even my little picky boy who is very choosy, soon as he sees the Greenies box he runs to get his share. from now on they will get a Greenies everyday for a treat.\n",
      "Greenies (96) were received quickly in a protective box. They were fresh in a resealable bag. I would order from vendor again.\n",
      "I have been buying Greenies for years - this company had the best price - very satisfied!!<br />Shipment arrived faster than promised and packaging was original from manufactuer.\n",
      "I've bought these greenies twice now from Amazon.  Amazon has one of the best prices on the Internet, but I still feel the product is way too expensive.  I'm now using a cheaper product from Walmart that is supposed to do the same thing so far as cleaning teeth.\n",
      "very cheap compared to buying in the stores. great price for this product. product was fresh not stale. i don't know why they insist on making you put 20 words down for just saying the product is low cost and good.\n",
      "We give Greenies (\"Teenie\" size) to our 12-year old miniature poodle. Her doctor has always commented on how clean and healthy her teeth and gums are and has never had to put her under for a cleaning. Her breath is nicer, too, since we started giving her Greenies.<br /><br />We give her one every day or so and she will carry it around 'protecting' it for an hour or so before settling down and devouring it. We tried other brands but she will only accept the best. She is terrified of thunderstorms and will come out from under the bed only if we offer her her favorite treat: a Greenie.\n",
      "We give our dog one of these per day to help clean her teeth.  I don't really know how well they work, but she loves them, and so we're happy to give them to her.  Amazon has absolutely the best price on these - I've looked extensively.  When we call \"greenie\" she comes running, and takes it to her special \"greenie chair\" to enjoy!\n",
      "I always buy greenies for my two dogs.  They each get one at night for dessert.  I try to get the best price and know that if I go through amazon.com, I will be able to see what the best value is.\n",
      "This is a great product, the puppies just love them and they are great for their teeth and breath at a good price.\n",
      "My dog, Lily, loves these dental chews...they are her favorite treat! It's the<br />one treat she looks most forward to every day.\n",
      "Both my dogs love these treats.  They trouble with rawhides and chicken strips but have had not trouble with these.\n",
      "My dog absolutely loves the greenies...he gets one at night and he thinks its a great treat!! Decent price for treats...\n",
      "My toy poodle loves the Greenies. I give him one every day. Along with brushing I feel the greenies are helping to keep his teeth clean.\n",
      "My dogs look forward to this treat every morning. It helps the breath issue and satisfies the chewing need as well! I can't be without them.\n",
      "Our dogs love Greenies, but of course, which doggies don't? I bought this for my dashchund and minpin, and it's perfect! A great price for a great product. Who could ask for more.\n",
      "Greenies!  My dog loves 'em.<br /><br />I like buying them from Amazon since they're so much cheaper than the pet store.\n",
      "You cant go wrong with greenies! My dogs love them and go nuts on them. Only downside to this is that its so soft it gets chewed up quickly so i dont quite see how this will improve the dogs teeth and gums.<br /><br />Amazon has the best prices by far and with no tax + amazon prime, this by far, becomes the cheapest place to buy products.\n",
      "Greenies are a healthy treat for dogs and they love them!  I first bought them while working at a hardware/feed store to give them a try. We were so pleased to find them on Amazon at nearly half the price.  Every dog owner should try them, they come in all sizes for all dogs and really do keep their teeth in great condition.\n",
      "My dogs love these. They start drooling everytime they get these. Not really sure if they do anything for their teeth/breath. Gave it 4 stars instead of 5 stars just because these are alittle pricey considering they are gone in like 30 seconds.\n",
      "Very quick delivery and same quality goods!  Cheaper than buying them at the actual pet store.  So, I'll be ordering again when I run out.  My dogs love them and their breath is a lot better.\n",
      "My 60 lb Ridgeback-mix is just crazy about these.  By about 10:30p he starts anticipating getting his nighttime treat and he won't leave me alone until I give him his Greenie.  I had a Sheltie-mix who didn't care for Greenies but this guy loves 'em.  The vet says they're good for him and we've never experienced any problems digestively speaking so if your four pawed friend is a Greenie fan, too, this is certainly a great price.  Shipping was reasonable, as well ... particularly when ordering several boxes ... and quick.\n",
      "My little dog who's rather picky about his treats absolutely loves Greenies REGULAR.  As he's getting older, I thought I'd go for the LITE since I'm sure regular Greenies have a lot higher calories.  So I bought Greenies LITE (teenie, 96 pack) and he sniffed at the first one and literally pushed it away with his nose and several more attempts have gone unsuccessful and I've been just handing them out to my friends' less-picky dogs.  Had to buy a tub of Greenies regular and surely enough, he sniffed at it, did his dance, grabbed it and ran away (well, he was so happy he skipped away) with it.  When I smell it, the regular definitely smells better/more appetizing whereas the LITE has the blah~ smell to it.  So if your dog already had a taste of regular Greenies, I suggest you stick with the regular.\n",
      "My postman started giving Maddie Greenies when she was about a year old, when he stopped I had to purchase them myself, she has one each day, she is now 13 1/2, she loves them I feel they are good for the gums and teeth, she has had very few pulled, looks good for a Senior.  I would highly recommend them to any one who has a pet.\n",
      "I've yet to meet a dog that wasn't absolutely nutty about Greenies, so being able to order them here at a comparatively economical price is wonderful. We keep them on hand; if we didn't our dogs would riot.\n",
      "My dog really enjoys these as a daily treat. However, until she has her next physical I really can't evaluate these properly. I will try to remember to update after her physical so I can report back if her tartar build-up has been reduced or eliminated. Our vet said they work IF your dog chews them slowly. Our dog goes through them pretty fast, so I am not sure if they are going to be effective. We decided to give them a year and see what happens.\n",
      "Even though these are pricey, my old Aussie Shep loves them. I am glad there is a special senior formula. Thanks Greenies!\n",
      "These Greenies are a great buy. I used to get the Petite size for my Bicon/Poodle and my Bichon, but found that you get more treats with the Teenies and the dogs enjoy them just as much. So, if you have small dogs up to say 25 or 30 pounds, the Teenies are the best. I don't think you can find them any cheaper.\n",
      "Dogs love these things. they sit around the cupboard begging for more. These are a great training tool for a food motivated dog.\n",
      "My puppy loves them. She burns through them like nobody's business and they give her a softer stool but she really goes nuts for them. She has no tartar and nice breath though\n",
      "My dogs love these things. They would eat the entire box at once if they could. Ask them who wants a greenie, and they run to the cupboard and bark.\n",
      "I purchased these for my dogs for thier teeth cleaning capabilities. My dogs love them and the price on Amazon was much better than in the stores. They do help with cleaning the tarter off of my dogs teeth\n",
      "My dog loves these Greenies,  they are very addictive. They have become his all time favorite treat. They are a little expensive but helps keep his teeth clean and he enjoys them so much.\n",
      "This is a favorite treat of our 7 month old standard poodle puppy. He is an aggressive chewer, so we need something which will occupy him. The Greenie really seems to satisfy  - after chewing through it (which, admittedly, only takes a few minutes) he will lie down and stop bothering us during dinner.<br /><br />I wish these were less expensive. Each Greenie costs about $1.50, so it pains me a little to see it evaporate so quickly. But that is a function of my dog, not the product.\n",
      "Amber loves her greenies and they sure help to keep her teeth clean.I hope this continues and I can avoid another expensive(dentel bill)from her vet.\n",
      "This product is a good value, good price.  Greenies can be much more expensive in pet food store.  Item is delivered quickly and it is sealed.  They always seem to be fresh and consistent.  I feed my dog (1) day so I go through them quickly.\n",
      "This is a great buy, I was paying over twice as much for a box of them. All three of my Poms love Greenies, and expect them every morning. :)\n",
      "My dog Sadie loves these bones!  They are her absolute favorite! Usually after I give her a different bone, she just likes to be chased around the bedroom, alot, but with these, one quick chase and she lays right down to chow on it. Once a week or longer is all I spoil her with these making them even more special.\n",
      "The price is excellent and the product arrived in a timely manner.  I will always buy this product from Amazon.\n",
      "Good value for a lot of treats! my dog absolutely loves these and it's awesome that they sell them on amazon for half the price of what they would sell it for at a pet store! Will continue buying from here as long as they're available :)\n",
      "My dogs are crazy for Greenies.  I love that they come in so many sizes.  I have two dogs and the teenies are perfect for my little dog and the petite are great for my medium dog.\n",
      "My three dogs love Greenies.  So much so that they know the exact time every evening they are supposed to get them! They act like kids in a candy store!\n",
      "We bought these because of the dogs bad breath... he seems to like them. His breath is better and they have not caused him any problems.\n",
      "Every evening, about the same time, our two dogs know when it is time for their Greenie treat. They will both come and sit in front of us and patiently wait for us to get their treat. If we are busy and ignore them they will give a soft cry to get our attention. Each one only gets one a day, but other than walks, petting and their dinner, the Greenie is a highlight of their day.\n",
      "I have two Boston Terriers and a Terrier mix.<br />They wait in line for these every morning.<br />Their breath is much better.<br />They are a little pricey, but worth it.\n",
      "Awesome product for keeping my doggies teeth clean and tarter free. It must be used everyday to be effective. I would highly recommend it for any breed.\n",
      "Finding this product on Amazon was like finding an unexpected Christmas present!<br /><br />Highly recommend by the vet, because of price, I save it for special occasion (always once a day) and, by far, the treat my dog just loves.  True story.  Since I am not able to walk my dog, when the mail lady delivers my mail, she often leaves screen door  open so Scrappy can take off and run for exercize.  She leaves screen door open, whe he has been out running when he should be back, the mail lady hollers \"Greenie, greenie\" and this 15# of black fur runs full speed ahead, into the patio and the door inside (which I left open.  A good testiment for a fantastic product!!\n",
      "No doggie breath for our dog.  People are always commenting that she doesn't have bad breath and her teeth look so clean.  A friend of ours who runs a veterinary and rescue clinic recommended them to us when our dog was very little, and we've sworn by them ever since.\n",
      "My little loved one gets a greenie a day. He loves them. I shop around for the best price on everything I buy and Amazon had the lowest price!\n",
      "Greenies are very muched loved as a tatsy Treat by are two small dogs!!! At 96 Chews they last a long time!!!\n",
      "I have 3 dogs and they each love Greenies and they know exactly where I hide them so when I am close to the treat door, they get all excited.  In addition my boys have the freshest breath at the dog park.\n",
      "Being the \"mom\" of three mini wirehair doxies I spend a lot of money on a number of things.  Imagine my surprise to find such a bargain of Greenies on Amazon.  I really must make a habit of first checking any purchases to see if available on Amazon.  Hang tough on the CA sales tax issue, I live in CA and I am taxed enough already.\n",
      "My girl (Amber) just loves her greenies.She knowes where I keep them and lets me know when she wants one.\n",
      "Our vet recommended this for our dog. It was selling for $37.99 at our local pet supply store. Found it here for way less!\n",
      "my pug misty is 7 years old i have given her greenies seince she was 4 months old. i give her 1 a day as a treat. i give them on the second time she goes out side in the morning and she loves them more than anything else that she gets and she knows what time it is. her teeth have been cleaned once the vet said her teeth are perfect. i buy greenies from amazon beacause the service and the price is the best there is.  billy j.  alabama.\n",
      "One of my two male Shih-tzus absolutely LIVES for his Greenie which he knows he gets to have after our morning walk, so they are an item that I cannot run out of! I haven't tasted the myself, not being a dog, and they do not smell good to me, either, but I buy these regularly and the ones I purchased here are the best price I have seen!\n",
      "When I first picked up my puppy, he didn't like any treats.  I was worried and asked  a co-worker about what treats his dog likes.  He mentioned how much his dog liked the greenies.  I went to the store, picked up a bag and I have been giving my puppy a greenie ever since.  He LOVES them and his breathe is much more fresh now.  His favorite treat.\n",
      "My yorky absolutely loves Greenies Chews.  They are good for him so I am very glad that he likes them so well.  They have a pleasant smell even to me.  My cats love greenies too, the feline variety.  I recommend them highly!\n",
      "My dog loves these treats.  He gets one every morning after he goes outside, and waits by the treat cabinet to get it.  They seem to be working great for his teeth.  We never brush his teeth, he's six years old, and the vet just said he doesn't need to have a teeth cleaning as his teeth look great.  I wish these were available on a subscription so they'd just come automatically!\n",
      "I've got two adopted rescue Chihuahuas . . . they would run me out of town on a rail if they didn't get their daily Teenie Greenies . . . Amazon has the best price around for this product . . . it's a winner all around . . .\n",
      "This is a great deal! At $25 per bag at the local pet store, I couldn't afford them (I have three dogs!). Now I can order these anytime.\n",
      "My two little boys love these treats. So much in fact that I've been cutting them in half so they can have them more than once a day. I honestly can't say that they reduce tartar but I can see how they would with their chewy texture.\n",
      "I have 3 90 pound dogs and I buy these in the 27 count boxes 2 at a time.<br />Each dog chews them as if they are munching on gold. It's like they are savoring each bite which is all the better for cleaning their teeth.<br />My veterinarian even noticed a difference in my dogs teeth after only 2 weeks. Like another contributor, I give them last thing at night before bed and I have don't know if the 2 are related but night time doggie gas has all but disappeared as well.......LOL\n",
      "Our Shiba loves these. Over a three week period we have observed a reasonable reduction in the amount of tarter on his teeth, especially the molars.<br /><br />We would continue to buy them from Amazon if the price were lower. However, a large shopper's club sells essentially the same product (ingredients, and including the capped box and inner packaging), while offering the product at a consistently lower cost: 10%-12% per unit.\n",
      "Good price. I'm not sure how they help with their teeth but my one dog just had teeth cleaned and just started giving these to her so will see if it's worth the price at the vet.\n",
      "My little pom absolutely loves the Greenies Dental Chews. Amazon provides the bigger pack of 96 at a cheaper price than you can find in stores. When they arrived today I told my dog her treats were here and she knew exactly what I was talking about. She was jumping up and down and could hardly wait for me to open the package. As soon as I got it opened she grabbed her little Greenie and went to town!!\n",
      "I have 2 boxers. 1 is 16 mos. and the other is 11 months. The older one, often gets what my husband and I call \"shrimp breath\". The younger one has lots of digestive issues. They both get 1 greenie a week. Vet says their teeth look great and it's helped with the bad breath. Also, doesn't give the little one runny poop, which is nice. Only problem is they are expensive, that's why they get one a week.\n",
      "My dog, Shadow,  loves Greenies more than any treat. He's a Pomeranian and gets the Teenies, and are we in trouble if we run out!  I just bought the tub of 96 on Amazon for less than half the money that the small packages cost at the store. Debbie\n",
      "I'm not sure this helps the tarter since my dogs need their teeth cleaned every other year but I can tell you they really love this stuff.  It does seem to help their breath, probably by settling their stomachs, and they never had a bad reaction to this treat.\n",
      "All 3 of my dogs-pom, yorkie, rat terrier, love these. I just received my 2nd order. Wish these were on sub. and save.\n",
      "My dogs love the greenies and their breath is alway good smelling. A good product.<br />I purchased this through Amazon for a better prlice than I normally get.  This is an expensive little treat but worth it.\n",
      "Best deal on greenies out there! Came fast and without any problems. My dog loves them and they make his breath smell good.\n",
      "When my Yorkie was about 10 1/2 years old, her breath suddenly became extremely nasty!  I thought, perhaps, the malodorous breath was caused by a bad tooth so I took her to the Vet for her annual checkup.  The Vet gave her a clean bill of health and suggested I have her teeth cleaned at the price of over $350!  Well, before forking over the big bucks, I thought I'd try brushing her teeth myself and headed to Petco to buy some doggie toothpaste.  I found the toothpaste and continued to walk around the store because Spunky just LOVES her Petco outings!  I let her sniff her way down the doggie treats aisle when we bumped into the boxes of Greenies.  After checking out a box, I thought it was certinaly worth a shot so I bought a box of 96-count Teenies for $35.<br /><br />As soon as we arrived home, I attempted to brush her teeth the best that I could and then gave her one Greenie.  She seemed to really enjoy it.  I typically buy everything on Amazon so I jumped on here to check the price and was pleasantly surprised to see that the cost was $10 less than Petco's.  I immediately ordered them from Amazon and when that box arrived a day later, I took that unopened box over to Petco and returned it to them to get my $35 back! :)  Very sweet deal.<br /><br />My dog is now a Greenies addict with sweet breath again!  I should create a video review sometime because it's hilarious to see this little Yorkie \"yelling\" for me outside of the pantry door.  She knows exactly where the Greenies are and every morning she runs over to the pantry and just barks for me to get her a Greenie.  I allow her to have two Greenies per day and she seems to know that's her quota.  Both Spunky and I are very happy with Greenies and will continue to buy them!\n",
      "These things aren't cheap, but there's nothing that gets my dog more excited than the thought of getting a Greenie. Whatever is inside of them is something he can't get enough of. I don't know about whether they are healthy, they don't seem to clean his teeth, but they certainly make him a very happy pooch.\n",
      "My dog loves these things - one in the morning<br /><br />Everyone makes a compliment  on her breath smelling good\n",
      "I have a notoriously finicky Chihuahua who wouldn't eat a regular dog treat if you coated it the best tasting thing on earth, and she certainly wouldn't let me brush her teeth. Ever since the first time I gave her a Greenie, my dog has gone nuts for these things. On our last trip to the vet they examined her teeth because I expressed concern that her overbite was preventing the Greenies from as effective as they should be. She can't really chew properly with the front teeth.<br /><br />This vet wasn't our usual vet because we went on a different day, but he looked at her teeth and asked how old she was. I said, \"Almost three.\" And he asked if I'd had her in to have her teeth cleaned before. \"No, I didn't know dogs could have their teeth cleaned.\"<br /><br />He went on to say that on a scale of one to four, one being the best and four being the worst, her teeth were a perfect one, which was surprising because Chihuahuas have teeth problems early on usually. I explained that I'd been using the Greenies since she was nine months old.<br /><br />I give her one Greenie every morning because they are so cheap on Amazon. In the store I pay twenty five dollars for a bag of twenty. I pay twenty two dollars on Amazon for a box of ninety six! It's easy to give her one daily. She is still marginally underweight, so I can't say they make her gain weight. She has no digestive issues and doesn't seem to be suffering from having them. Her breath is fresh, her teeth are white and tartar free, and she's a very happy dog.\n",
      "Have used greenies since they came out and they definitely help keep your dog's teeth clean. My dog gets excited about being treated to a Greenie everyday. The pricing was very attractive through Amazon, as much as half of what you would pay at a pet store. Very impressed with the product.\n",
      "Well, the ingredients list is a little questionable to me personally.<br />However, after comparing to most other brands, such as Nylabone, Pegetables etc, they all seem the same.<br />This is economically priced so it does not break the bank.<br />My dog loves and goes crazy for it, and I haven't heard of any problems/recalls with this product.<br /><br />So overall, it's great I guess.\n",
      "I have two 60-65 lb greyhounds and I buy the Teenie sized greenies as a snack twice a day.  I use it as a bribe in order to get their teeth brushed.  I'm not sure how well they work for deterring tartar but they seem to love it.  Doesn't seem to cause any digestive problems as my hounds have sensitive stomachs.  Another reason why I like the teenie size is becacause they can be rationed out to last longer rather than getting the \"large or X-Lg\" greenie where you get fewer pieces.\n",
      "Our cute little dog had the breath from hell! This product actually works! She loves them as treats and her breath is waaaaaaay better!\n",
      "Our dogs love these.  The vet always compliments us on brushing the dogs' teeth, but we never have.  (Seriously, if someone has ever accomplished this without the dog making various dramatic escape attempts and trying to eat the toothpaste, please tell me your secret.)  We just give them each one of these every day and a bunch of rawhide to chew on, seems to do the trick.\n",
      "Exactly what I ordered. Product was just as if I had bought it in the store, only a way better deal. Fast shipment. Very satisfied with this transaction. will definitely do business with this merchant again if they have what I am in the market for.\n",
      "Maddie loves her greenie treats,she would eat the whole box if I allowed her..The treats are very special to her..As soon as I give her one she heads for the couch, away from everybody,so she can relish her treat in private...Also good for her teeth..Great treats for my little dog..very pleased with them\n",
      "For the past 5 years my dog has been starting his day with a greenie.  He still gets excited about this morning treat and appears disappointed when I run out.  Since he controls the household, I buy them.\n",
      "My dog, a 13 year old Bichon Frise' has been loving these Greenies for many years. Our vet says that his teeth and gums are excellent although he has never had his teeth cleaned or brushed. Could it be the Greenies? I'm sure of it.<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KEVF32\">Greenies Dental Chews for Dogs, Regular, Pack of 27</a>\n",
      "We get the Regular and the Petite, for after meal or instead of meal treats.  Brutus and Popeye review this product at 12 out of 10!  Until we tried Greenies, Brutus turned his nose up on almost everything we gave him.  Now he has something he really enjoys.  Popeye, on the other hand, is a different story.  He would eat the box, so we can't use him as a judge.\n",
      "I usually buy these at the pet store, but the price was great, and the product arrived fresh. These little chewies are a boon for dog's dental health, but also for their digestive tract. Highly digestible, just the right amount of 'chew' for my older dog...Greenies are a great adjunct to yearly cleaning. They do not take the place of cleaning, and dental decay is a huge problem in dogs as they age. I want my special girl to stay healthy, pain free, and happy as long as she can...and Greenies make her healthy, happy, and sweet breathed.\n",
      "Our dog loves these and our vet agrees that it helps keep her breath fresh and her teeth clean.  And this is the best pricing I've found so far. Your dog will love you even more!\n",
      "These are a bit expensive but when it comes to your pet, especially one with bad breat like mine, it's worth it. My bog is 65 pounds but I give her the petite be causes it saves money and cuts calories. I have tried everything to get her breath smelling decent or even bearable and this is the only thing. One petite greenie once a day or once every two days keeps her breath minty fresh. It's also grt for their teeth, she hasn't had to have her teeth cleaned at the vet once since she started eating these.\n",
      "I wish these things weren't so expensive, because they're the only thing that seems to work for my dog's AWFUL breath!\n",
      "I used to buy these at Petsmart - not anymore!  Same exact product considerably cheaper.  I usually tack them on to other orders to take advantage of free shipping.  God forbid I don't have a supply of Greenies in the house...\n",
      "My dog loves these!  He has learned the word 'greenie'! It's good for him but he treats it like a favored treat.  I only use one a day, but he has accepted that and loves them.  They are good for his teeth - he has better teeth than I do!\n",
      "This is a great product to help maintain dog dental care. My dog looks forward to getting her treat every night\n",
      "My vet recommended these, and the Wonder Dog loves them! They're a bit pricey and smell terrible to me, but apparently smell great to a dog!\n",
      "I love this product!  My dog would not chew on toys or rawhide things and her teeth were getting brown in the back from just foods she ate without cleaning them. My vet told me about Greenies, so I went on a search online for the best prices. They are wonderful, she gets one a day, chews it so it actually is helping with her teeth cleaning. It's all natural and even her breath smells better :)\n",
      "These are \"minis\" but seriously plenty for even a bigger dog like a boxer.  We give it to Mocha about 2 to 3 times a week to keep here breath from smelling like the crypt keepers shorts . . .\n",
      "I have never seen my dogs as happy as when they seem me take out the greenies bag.  They are pricey but, what can you do?\n",
      "This was an awesome deal!  I will absolutely continue to buy these through Amazon, now I have 2 dogs and it would have been getting really costly at the old place I purchased them from.  Thank you!!\n",
      "I have two rescue Beagles and they get one Greenie per day.  Geat treat and they love them.  Also good for their teeth.\n",
      "We NEVER run out of Greenies! My little baby loves these treats. It is an added bonus that they are good for dental care as well.  Greenies got a bad rap for a while but they have been reformulated and are chewier now. We buy the teenie size for her because she is only ten pounds. My Mia dances for these treats and leads (herds) us to the treat jar for her daily fix!  Amazon has the best price for this quantity and shipping was fast!\n",
      "My dog goes crazy for these. He won't touch the Virbac dog chews. He's not a chewer, so the fact that he will chew these means they must taste really good. They're expensive, but because my dog will eat them, it's worth the cost.\n",
      "I should take a video of my dog drooling when I ask him if he wants a Greenie!  No other treat can compare as far as he's concerned -- and this is a dog who will eat just about anything.  He happily trots into his crate every night at bedtime because he knows that's when I'll give him this special treat.  Seriously, if he could skip, he would skip.  At a little over $1.40 per treat, Greenies are more expensive than I would typically pay, but I like how they freshen his breath, clean his teeth, & are generally healthy for him.  There may be other products out there that claim to have the same benefits, but none I've tried so far have that \"tail-wagging drool\" factor which, to be honest, makes me feel all warm and fuzzy at bedtime too :)\n",
      "I have two dogs that are absolutely nuts for Greenies!! One dog is so picky about what he eats that it really suprised me that one of his favorite things would be a Greenie!\n",
      "Our full sized Goldendoodle gets one every day.  According to our vet, his teeth and gums \"look great\".  I also have purchased the feline greenies for my daughter when she complained that hr cat had \"bad breath\".  3 chews/3 days later=no more bad breath.\n",
      "Both my Maltese and Chiweenie pup really dig these greenie's. I break the teenies in half for the chiweenie to spare the money.  Just like the people food, the healthier, the more pricey. But they do like these and would rather the greenies than anything else. 2nd time purchasing from here and shipment is quick and easy.  I am a student prime member- FREE FOR A YEAR!\n",
      "When I got my dog he was 6 and had recently had his teeth cleaned.  Now he is 13 and, with eating a greenie a day, has not needed to have them done again.  He loves these treats!\n",
      "My dog has a very sensitive stomach and this is the only treat that agrees with her.  She gets one a day which I use to coax her onto her crate in the morning.  She saves the Greenie until I return home in the afternoon, like it's her treat for being such a good girl all day.  So funny!\n",
      "I have a 3 year old Siberian Husky, who has to be the pickiest dog in the world. He will go days without eating if I don't give him exactly what he wants. I must have 15-20 bags of different treats that he turns his nose up at (Busy bones, busy rollhides, busy granola, biscuits, chicken jerky treats, etc.) Greenies are the ONLY thing I can give him that I know for a fact he will eat. In fact, Siberian Huskies rarely if ever bark, but if I even go near him while he's chewing on the greenie he'll starting barking at me.. and well trying to take it away is another story. These things are EXPENSIVE, but it is cheaper in the long run than paying $10 for a bag of treat where he'll have 1 or 2 and be done.\n",
      "My dog likes the Greenies. They seem to be a little more than other products of this type. But they do appear worth the money as they are well liked by pooches and do the job of cleaning teeth well.\n",
      "We've been buying Greenies for our two dachshunds for many years now. The dogs love them, and they seem to be good for the dogs. We plan to keep it up.\n",
      "My dog has been eating these after his dinner for years. They keep his breath clean and limit the build up of plac. He waits with anticipation his greenie after his meal, running to get one out of my hand. Digestion has been no problem at all and the formula is soft enough to prevent any form of choking. I would highly recommend this product.\n",
      "My 3 hounds (2 small, one large) have one of these after breakfast every morning.  They know the routine and go stare at the box as soon as they come in from breakfast.  Just the right size snack and it cleans their teeth and breath.  Good stuff.\n",
      "I'm not sure what's in these. Very odd odor & texture, but my dog absolutely loves them.  They also help calm her stomach and clean her teeth.  I've gotten these for her before at the local pet superstore, and found them on here for a few bucks cheaper.  Great seller and fast shipping.\n",
      "I have two cocker spaniels that are absolutely crazy over Greenies, we have to spell it out and they still know what it is! All I know is that if it makes my dogs this happy then it makes me happy!\n",
      "My dogs love Greenies. They are a healthy chewing snack for dogs. I was pleased to purchase Greenies at such a great price. I paid under $23.00 for a tub of 96 tiny Greenies. The same package sells for at least $10 to $15 more for the same product. I will continue to purchase this product from Amazon.com.\n",
      "Our Great Dane prefers Greenies over any other treat.  She really likes the small ones.  Because they are expensive we limit her to one \"special Greenie\" a week.  She knows when we get the box down and gets very excited.\n",
      "Greenies are wonderful, my dog loves them and chews them up! I don't notice much as far as better breath, but I already brush his teeth and scale them. He gets 1 greenie each night for a snack :)<br /><br />(To the bad reviews/comments...if your dog is one to scarf treats and does not chew things up before swallowing, these are not a good idea! If your dog enjoys the chewing and gnawing, make sure you get the proper size for your dog so they do not choke. Also giving these to puppies can upset their stomache, hints the diarhhea comment previously)\n",
      "My dog likes to chew it but it's \"heavy weight\" even for this petite size. It's almost like 1/2 of her lunch. But it's very safe to use--my dog got choked often when she was chewing the rawhides or pig ears but never had problem with this one. Howwever, it's quite thick and dense. Wish they could make the shape flat and thin, that way, it will provide longer chewing and more fun. My 50lb dog consumes it in less than 20 seconds. She got a pack of Trixie Dentafun Kauchips 100g made in Germany from my best friend. The Trixie Chews are superior than ANY existing dog dental chews in the US market. But unfortunately, we don't have it here.\n",
      "These are the BEST dog treats EVER!!!  Thanks for the prompt service and good pricing!  Check out goodpersontest.net.\n",
      "Son excelentes, les encantan a mis perritos y le mantienen el aliento fresco. llegaron a tiempo y en perfecto estado. estoy satisfecha con el producto y el envio.\n",
      "My dog loves these treats and I give one as a reward after I brush his teeth.  I can't determine at this point if they help clean his teeth.\n",
      "Good product & my dogs love them. But, over priced like most Pet treats.<br />I did get fast delivery & good service as usual.\n",
      "A great treat that your dogs will love. Even our slightly picky dogs love these treats. They clean their teeth too! Also, they don't smell like some rawhides and other natural products. I wish the lasted a little longer - our larger dog eats his in a couple of minutes.\n",
      "Our three dogs, 2 Cairn Terriers (5 & 4) and a 15+ year old border collie are proud of their Greenies. They like the taste and it helps keep their gums and teeth in good shape.\n",
      "I have given my dog greenies before, and he LOVES them!  Moreover, I love the fact that they keep his teeth and gums clean and healthy!  Buying through Amazon is so much cheaper than buying at a petstore, and I love the storage box that the greenies came in!  Highly reccommend, but be sure to buy the correct size treats for your pup!\n",
      "Love em, love em, love em.  Need a bigger box I think.  Better than paying for a dentist thats for sure.  Remember to brush>  All paws up on this\n",
      "We have been giving these dental chews to our little Pomeranian for over 3 years now. The vet always says we do a great job with brushing her teeth and gums although it is these chewies that do the job! Highly recommended!\n",
      "our dogs love greenies. we give them greenies that are smaller than recommended for their size though because they are quite expensive but they still do a nice job of cleaning up their breath.\n",
      "My dog won't chew rawhides or any bone really, I've tried them all. After spending $350 to get his teeth cleaned, and getting 15 teeth pulled due to decay, I was on a mission to find something he'd chew on to help clean his teeth. He LOVES these!He's around 12 lbs.  I think the bones are a little on the small side, so next time I'll go up a size, so it'll last longer.\n",
      "Nothing wrong with this product as far as the dogs are concerned.  They always want more than just one a day but we try to limit them to that amount for their own good and our pocket book.\n",
      "My dogs love these, and everything I've read suggests that they're good for the dogs, especially for the dogs' teeth. One of my dogs sometimes won't eat her regular food, or will eat it slowly, but she will always eat her Greenies right away.\n",
      "My two yorkie/apso dogs come in from morning outing and get all excited waiting for their Greenie.  They've been getting one teenie size every morning for only 2 months - but their teeth and breath are looking and smelling good.  I recommend this healthy treat.\n",
      "The new Greenies are so much easier for our dog to chew up. She only gets 1-2 per week but enjoys them each time. Buying them via Amazon always saves us money.\n",
      "I don't write too many reviews, but I read them all the time...so I though it was high time I wrote a review for this product (my dog told me to).  I have a Maltichon and she loves her mid-day treat.  Her breath was horrible, so I thought this might freshen it up a bit.  First of all, so goes BONKERS when I take this Greenie treat out.  The smell is so-so...and her breath is at least 1/2 better than is was before.  The greenies are not hard - you can bend them.  Not that the dog notices, but they are in the cute shape of a toothbrush.  She (the dog) runs around the house and hides the treat, then finally gives in and gobbles it up.  She then sniffs all over the place - hoping there is a crumb left behind.  There must be some doggie drug in those things, that's how much she loves them.  So - long story short - your dog would be crazy to NOT love these treats!  Worth the price - and they come in a nice container with a plastic lid that you just pop off to take a treat out.\n",
      "Since my pet does not like having his teeth cleaned, I have been giving him greenies for the past six years.  Each vet check-up confirms that he has no plaque buildup.  He is a picky eater but loves the taste of them as well.\n",
      "I buy greenies for  my two best friends.  My vet commented on how their teeth are looking good because of the greenies.  My ten year old Scottish terrier and my four year old Standard Poodle will dance circles for their greenis..lol.  How cool is that?\n",
      "Our Newf Owen is a Senior citizen now so wanted to switch him over to a treat that fit his mature lifestyle.  He loves these just as he did the regular Greenies.\n",
      "Seriously, my dog goes absolutely bats#*t crazy over these things! Her teeth are cleaner, and her breath is nice and fresh. Highly recommended.\n",
      "Our terrier mix adores Greenies (haven't met a dog who doesn't love them, actually)... they kind of have a gummy-bear quality. We give him one before we leave for work so he has a little distraction (only takes him a few minutes to finish one). These are $1.50/ea at our local pet supply store, so buying them in bulk is the way to go. We bought them from Entirely Pets and got a great deal with fast shipping.\n",
      "Excellent product. Your dogs will love them. I wouldn't recommend them for dogs over 25 pounds as they may pose a choking hazard for quick eaters.\n",
      "Buying the greenies online is the way to go..  They cost about $10 cheaper than if you were to walk into a chain pet store.\n",
      "Vet recommended them for my small dogs due to dental problems.  They enjoy them a lot.\n",
      "My little girl doggie loves these..and great for her teeth.  Less expensive than at the pet store when I buy four it's like getting one free!  Great product!\n",
      "These are a great training aid for dogs because they seem to like them so much.  I have one dog but have offered them to others as well when I go to the dog park.  I have had great luck using these for rewards when she follows the commands.\n",
      "For some reason, these are nearly twice the price locally.  My dog likes these and his teeth/gums seem cleaner, but I don't know how to quantify that.  The foil bag inside the cardboard container is reclosable which helps a great deal with freshness.\n",
      "I've had my pug Koa for over 6 years now. Since 2 years I've been providing him with greenies and he just loves it!  Every vet visit comments how well his teeth look with hardly any plaque at all; amazing!  I've pretty much invested a lot of money for my service animal pug who is worth every penny.  But with purchasing different pricing each time through Amazon is something I don't understand.  It would be great for return loyal patrons to purchase same price or honor discount pricing.\n",
      "I have three terriers and most often foster another dog. My dogs will do ANYTHING for a Greenie. One races through agility, because a Greenie awaits him at the end of the class--in addition to small treats after each run.  Right now I am fostering a traumatized little poodle who feared his crate; a Greenie at the back of the crate and he will quickly go in. And Greenies are good for their breath/teeth, healthy and easily digestible. My vet, too, recommends them.\n",
      "My dog (maltese-) loves greenies. It's her fav treat and knowing that is good for her and is cleaning her teeth makes me feel great !! ;)\n",
      "My dogs absolutely love greenies and any time I can save money buying them that's a plus.  They are twice the price at any pet or grocery store.\n",
      "Received as promised. What can you say about dog treats? I personally haven't tasted one! lol Shipper was prompt for delivery.\n",
      "My dog is so picky,but when it comes to geenies,he loves them.<br />So to me,greenies are a heathy treat and helps keep his teath clean.<br />Thank you greenies\n",
      "My two little Italian Greyhounds love Greenies. I did buy the wrong size Greenies this time. I usually buy the teenie Greenies with 96 in the package for aprox the same price, but I must have hit the wrong size product. Not too big a deal, I just break them in 1/2.<br />The product arrived very quickly and I will be certain to order again in the future....thought I will be sure to order the correct size next time!\n",
      "Greenies are recommended for dog dental care and this is the best price I can find and free shipping.\n",
      "Between 11:30 and noon every day, my dog starts to hound us for his one a day Greenie! He loves them, and they have his veterinarian's approval. This is a great product...I've used it for years. The site is easy to navigate, and delivery is always prompt.\n",
      "Our pet loves having greenies as treat, she gets crazy every time she hears or see us opening the package. Her breath also gets better after eating her treat.\n",
      "Our dogs like their Greenie in the morning. It makes them happy and also helps to reduce their dog breath. I don't know that it provides any other dental advantages.\n",
      "My dog goes crazy when I mention the word Greenies.  He hasn't put on any extra weight since I have been giving them to him.  He gets one per day and always lets me know when it is time to have one.  The cost is a little high so I buy them in the larger quantity.\n",
      "I buy these time and time again. I noticed an immediate improvement in my dog's breath (no stink...he gets in my face all the time) and there's no plaque on his teeth.\n",
      "My 1yr old pup loves greenies. He's been snacking on these since he was a month old. His breath always smells great and no tummy aches.\n",
      "Our dog knows the word Greenies so we have to call them Gs, but never to her! We don't want to have to come up with another name. These are an absolute must. The dog must have them. That is all there is to it. The fact that we could find the \"lite\" greenies was an added bonus.\n",
      "My \"Sammy\" is very picky on treats but he loves these and the best thing is he is 7 and a half years old and has never had to have his teeth cleaned. The Vet says his teeth are clear of tartar so I've saved enough in Vet bills to more than pay for his special chews\n",
      "These are our dog's absolute favorite treat!  As recommended, we only give one each day and make sure he doesn't get choked.  These are not as tough to chew as the old formula, which took him longer to chew.  Greenies are supposed to help clean dogs' teeth and breath, but we buy them because he loves them so much.  The large box of Teenie size has 96, so they aren't that expensive at one a day.  Well worth the price for our loyal baby!  He's been enjoying them for several years with no problems.  Be sure to get the correct size so your dog can't gobble them whole.\n",
      "As always, the perfect snack for my dog.  He just loves them and knows exactly when it is 8:00 p.m. and starts to ask for his!!!  As that is the time of evening he gets his \"Greenie\" snack\".  Thank you for the excellent product and fast delivery.\n",
      "My two babies just LOVE this product - they cannot get enough.  They usually get their treat just before bedtime.  When they know the time is nearing, they sit on the bed and anxiously await their bedtime treat.  Although the bones are small, I cut each bone into four pieces so they think they are getting multiple bones.  This item is a win win for my little ones!!\n",
      "My small Westie terrier absolutely loves his Greenies! I had other Westies in the past years and these were also their favorite treat. The company was sold and they changed the formula years ago and made them safer for the dogs to eat. They are the BEST!\n",
      "We ordered this after paying pet store prices for greenies for our 5 dogs and this has been a godsend! Larger container and affordable price I would be remiss to ever get them anywhere else again!\n",
      "I don't know much from a personal point of view, but Dycee say's they're necessary. She loves them and wouldn't be a very happy pooch without them. If you have a dog, you probably know what I mean. This is one of her MUST HAVES.\n",
      "Greenies are an great product - they are very attractive to my dog, who can be picky about treats, and provide a good chew that helps address his tartar problems, and Amazon has among the best price I've found.<br /><br />As long as you have someplace out of dog-nose reach to store the box, Greenies are a great way to help your dogs teeth stay clean and thus avoid the further health issues that result from canine dental problems.\n",
      "My dog is goofy enough but when he knows one of these are comming,  he really goes nuts.  I did not have a hitch in the order or length of time getting them. Thank you so much, Linda Turner I would recommend ordering these to anyone. Greenies have been a part of my dogs lives for nearly thirteen years and they look forward to one everyday. I ordered them from Amazon and everything went smoothly.\n",
      "I have three dogs and they get a greenie every day.  You will be amazed to see what these treats can do for your dogs teeth.  Buy on Amazon for the best value.  Some stores sell these for more than $30 a box.\n",
      "This is a great product that most dogs absolutely love. It's great for the teeth and great for their morale. I give my coton a treat every morning when I leave for work. The product on Amazon is considerably cheaper than it is at the local petstore and the 96 size is perfect for dogs under 20lbs.\n",
      "Dogs LOVE Greenies!  They go crazy if they even think they hear the greenie bag...my tiny little Italian Greyhound girl gets a greenie at bedtime, and sometimes she starts pushing us to go to bed and getting wild and begging to go to bed, because she wants her greenie.  You do have to be careful and only feed them one a day of their size range, or they will upset their stomach...you can have too much of a good thing, but as long as you don't overdo it, the dogs love them, and it's a great treat for them!\n",
      "Greenies have been a part of my dogs lives for nearly thirteen years and they look forward to one everyday.  I ordered them from Amazon and everything went smoothly.  I did not have a hitch in the order or length of time getting them. Thank you so much, Linda Turner  I would recommend ordering these to anyone.\n",
      "My dogs love their Greenies.  I would buy 6 to save money. It is a must for treat time. All I have to do is say Greenies and you see the tails wag.\n",
      "My dog loves these, This was an awesome price too! These are sometimes 40 bucks at the stores for a 27 pack. I will def buy these again.\n",
      "My dog eats a greenie a day and we were very excited to have found them here at such a great price.  The package arrived in perfect condition and they are very fresh.  I have chosen this size Greenie for my chihuahhua, who is approximately 12 pounds.  It has proven to be effective for us, though through time I still notice some tartar buildup on the very back teeth (molars).  Therefore, I am sure to still brush them frequently.  He loves the taste and has been eating them for about a year and a half.\n",
      "Our three dogs are addicted to Greenies. Even at one treat per day it has become an expensive habit but one we are willing to promote.  We were thrilled to find such a great price and free shipping!\n",
      "These to are a very good way to help keep my dog's teeth and gums clean and she loves them too.\n",
      "my dog loves these...he would eat these things for regular food if you would let him.  breath is also wonderful.\n",
      "Greenies Bones are the best treat my dog of 11 years can think of!  Even after all of these years, they remain his #1 favorite - looked forward to - every evening - extra special - treat - no bones about it !!!!! Very affordable pricing and shipping.  Would recommend seller and will be buying more from them myself!\n",
      "Our Pomeranian LOVES Greenies, But I Was Getting Really Tired Of Spending Almost 50 Dollars A Pack At The Local Pet Store, So I Decided To Check On Amazon. I Spent A Lot Of Time Checking Prices From All The Different Sellers And Found That These Ones Were The Cheapest. I Ended Up Getting 2 Boxes For The Same Price That I Would Have Paid For 1 Box At The Pet Store.<br />The Package Arrived Very Quickly & We Even Recieved A Free Sample Size Bag Of Dog Food, Which Was An Unexpected Bonus. The Only Issue I Had Was I Feel They Could Have Put Everything In A Smaller Shipping Box. Other Then That We Are Extremely Satisfied & So Is Our Sweet Little Pom. Thank You Amazon!\n",
      "My dogs get their Greenies at noon, can hardly wait to gnaw on them, and and then chew heartly until the Greenies disappear.  The good news is that all my dogs now have clean teeth.\n",
      "Just small enough, but not too big for my dog. He loves it and it helps keep his teeth clean.\n",
      "My dogs love these. They each get one a day. Amazon's prices are great! Thanks...\n",
      "My jack russell, Didi, absolutely loves Greenies!  All I have to say is, \"Do you want a greenie?\", and her little head cocks to the side and she runs to the Greenies bag.  A greenie a day makes your dog very happy!!\n",
      "I found this site to have the best price for the quantities on the web. I would definitely order from here again.\n",
      "<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KBFKIQ\">Greenies Dental Treats for Dogs, Petite Pack, 27 oz, 45 chews</a><br />My chihuahuas love Greenies and will do anything to get one. My cats also love Cat Greenies. I use the Greenies Pill Pockets to give my animals pills and/or vitamins.  Great product and good for them also. Make great training tools... Greenies come in the size to fit your dog. Chihuahua size treats are hard to find. I highly recommend Greenies for dogs and cats.\n",
      "My mini poodle loves these greenies...his groomer also uses them and we just went to a vet who was also familiar with them....all dogs seem to love these \"toothbrushes\"...highly recommend them..\n",
      "I don't know about others, but my dog loves these.  He's a 55lbs golden retriever mix puppy, and loves to chew.  Like a reviewer before me said, this product is like crack for dogs!  The chews don't leave a mess, they occupy my dog for a couple of minutes, clean his teeth and they get rid of bad breath.  A lot of chews are either messy or leave him with bad breath -- or both.  No digestion problems either, like rawhide can cause.  He did have a problem once with a rawhide chew that got us worried - I presume that's the compressed product related problem that a previous reviewer mentioned.  This never happened with the Greenies as they mostly melt away rather than break off in pieces, unlike rawhide.  As far as I can tell, this is a great product.\n",
      "My small dog loves his greenies. I give him a greenie after dinner. Goodness, if I forget he sure remembers it's time for his delicious treat. These are great at keeping his teeth clean. I still brush his teeth once a week, but these help keep his teeth healthy and strong between brushes.\n",
      "These are great for our dog and the price is great on Amazon.com for the large package.\n",
      "I adopted my dog because her previous owner had passed away.  My dog had been eating canned food and her teeth looked terrible.  I tried a couple of teeth whitening treats and toys, but Bailey would have nothing to do with them.  Then I found Greenies and she loves them.  Once she left a couple puddles of saliva on the floor as I was getting out a greenie for her, she was salivating so much.  Her teeth look so much better now and her breath is great.\n",
      "Both of my dogs will practically sell their souls for a greenie treat.  They know that this is the sign that it is time to go into their crates for the evening and after getting a greenie, they willingly go to bed.\n",
      "Great buy for the great product, it saves me money and i don't even have to leave my house. I will buy this product again from amazon only.\n",
      "My friend gave me some of these greenies that were left from her dog.  I gave my dog one and he was sold.  Never thought he would eat these.  Good breath now and also is a picky eater...Quick delivery and good price.\n",
      "My dogs are absolutely addicted to these.  Never had any digestion problems.  They keep my chihuahua's teeth super clean, my beagle/dachund's teeth need a little more help.  I personally don't care for the smell of them, but it's really not too bad.\n",
      "I ordered these on sale on the evening of 02/08/10,( ususlly with an item on sale such as this, you get gouged on the shipping/processing fees, but that was not the case with this vendor!) and they were on my doorstep on 2/11/10. Excellent communications from this vendor, with an email order confirmation,and an order shipped/tracking confirmation, and super fast shipping. A++\n",
      "We used to get greenies from Petco, what an amazing price difference this is!  Our beagle eats one every day and it keeps her breath in check.\n",
      "Looking for a treat that will never be refused, or left lying around?  Our greyhound loves Greenies and the Greenies are doing a great job of keeping his teeth in good shape.\n",

      "My vet told me to have my dog get these to help with her teeth and she loves them\n",
      "My dogs eat a greenie everymorning and they are so expensive everywhere in the stores! I was so happy to find some many of them for such an inexpensive price!! such a great deal!!\n",
      "I buy these locally, and they are more expensive than Amazon.com.<br />My dog likes them and we do see a difference in her teeth.<br />Thanks.\n",
      "I have no personal experience with Greenies but my dog loves them.  Her rating is grrrreat!\n",

      "My dog absolutely loved Greenies. He would come downstairs every morning and sit in front of the pantry until someone gave him his Greenies. He also learned to do all sort of cute tricks. We taught him these tricks with Greenies as his incentive. These treats were healthy for him, never made him sick, and made his breath smell good. I would only give him one Greenies a day and to spread that one Greenie out over the entire day, I would take pliers and cut it into 6-8 little pieces. Seemed like my dog would feel more fulfilled to have little pieces throughout the day versus one whole Greenie once a day. Once I discovered Greenies, I cut all the other treats out and really only have him the Greenies. The 27oz. tub was in my opinion a really good value for the money so I would always buy that size. I highly recommend this product for all dogs.\n",
      "This is a terrific price for this product and quantity. The package always arrives early.\n",
      "Our girls have to have their Greenies before bedtime. They are 30 and 40 lb border collies, but we give them the Teenie Greenies, sometimes two, they go NUTS over them!\n",

      "My dogs LOVE Greenies!!  I have offered them a choice of Greenies or Nutri Dent several times......Greenies are their choice every time.  The Nutri Dents just don't cut it with them.  Greenies are the best!!!!\n",
      "I give my dog 1 Greenie in the morning, he loves them and the vet that he goes to says they are the best for keeping their teeth strong and clean.<br />I highly recommend these for your dog or cat for the health of it.\n",
      "Product delivered quickly and item was as advertised.  No complaints here, I recommend this seller on a very high scale.  Keep up the good work and your customers will be well pleased.\n",
      "My cavalier king charles spaniel and a friend's beagle can't survive without greenies!!!  Fantastic product and great seller...\n",
      "Superb business.  I do not think this item could have been shipped and received any quicker unless I had driven to a local store and picked it up myself.  Wish all Internet businesses would strive to do transaction this way.  Adds confidence and credibility to the e-commerce world.\n",
      "Most dogs LOVE Greenies, and they are supposed to be great for their teeth, but they are also quite expensive. I found this 96 count package on Amazon for under 25.00!!!! Note that this is the petite size as I have little dogs, so if you are looking for the larger Greenies you need to check the pricing. The product arrived within a couple of days, and is a great value. Normally a package of 6 or so petite Greenies cost aprox 7.00!\n",
      "My dog loves his Greenies. I give him one in the evening hoping that it cleans his teeth.\n",
      "This is a FANTASTIC price on Greenies and my dog cannot live without having at least 1 a day ! Thanks for a great product at a great price !\n",
      "My dog loves Greenies Treats and because they are good fo rher that makes them even better!\n",
      "This is her goodnight treat.  She loves these.  We do not give her more then one a day and we like the teenie size the best.\n",
      "I always buy these on line for the dogs because the pet stores and grocery store prices are four times more.  For my small 10 pound dogs, I should have bought the teenie vice petite size though.  Great product.\n",
      "My Mom and Dad loved the price, and I just think these are way yummy. Keep 'em coming I say! As for delivery time, they ordered them and we had them in a box within a few days. Not quite as fast as the pet store, but they say for less money - even with shipping. Personally, I need them more frequently than my parents give them to me, please can I have another greenie, I love minty fresh breath! I'll be good! by Alex a Vizsla\n",
      "I have been buying this product for quite some time. My dogs love them. I was disappointed at how much the price went up recently. I was also angry when I got my purchase which was advertised as 19 in a box and there were only 17.\n",
      "Our Papillions love Greenies!  They help keep the tartar under control.  This breed is notorious for bad tartar build up on their teeth and having to have dentals twice a year.  With using the Greenies daily, they only have to have a dental once a year.  This saves us over $400/year.\n",
      "My dog loves Greenies treats, so I ordered him a big box for his Christmas gift.  He's been enjoying one every day.  I feel good feeding him these treats because they are recommended by my Vet and they are a natural treat that he enjoys.\n",
      "My dog loves the Greenies. He is a 12lbs pug and the Tiny size were too small for him.  These are a better size for him.  He loves them.  He recently decided that he didn't like many of his treats but he still loves these.\n",
      "These treats occupy my dogs (quietly!) while they clean their teeth at the same time. The first time I tried them, I bought the large ones to cut in half so I'd get more for my money, but believe me, it was definitely NOT worth the hassle. They are very hard and hard to cut. The \"Regular\" size is perfect for my 50-65 lb. dogs.\n",
      "I do like that the Greenies are softer, more chewable.  I feel it makes the product a little bit safer for my dogs to have.\n",
      "My dog was on a bland diet (boiled chicken & rice) so his poop was usually solid but a few days after eating 1 Greenie a day, his poop became more liquid-y and green. Not sure if Greenies was actually the cause until I googled and read on various dog forums about how Greenies have affected other dogs. Stopped giving out my dog Greenies and have thrown them away. BEWARE, Greenies CAN be bad, so watch your dog after giving them out.\n",
      "Not the best product for the price. I got these for my dog that has plaque problems but I haven't really seen any improvement since we got them. They are okay to give as a treat but as far as helping with plaque I don't think they work at all.\n",
      "There is contradicting information.  The description says Senior Greenie Large, while the photo shows \"regular\" as well as 27 treats versus 27 ounce.  Anyone that reviews and can clarify the actual product would be much appreciated.\n",
      "I was amazed at how well these cleaned my dogs teeth. He is not happy with getting his teeth brushed, especially in the back, the Greenies have assisted with cleaning this hard to reach area. I have read other reviews where people have had trouble with their dogs trying to chew off too much and choking or what-ever - my solution stay with your dog as they chew anything this is just plain common sense. I also give it after his evening meal so that he won't try to swallow to big of bites.\n",
      "This was an Excellent value of buying on Amazon versus the pet stores.<br />It was packaged and labeled well for shipment.<br /><br />However - the manufacturer's plastic top of the box itself is a little cheap and less functional than I expected.  Frankly, the whole top has to come off each time I want to give my dog a single chew.<br /><br />So - I'm actually putting these chews into a Dog treat jar that has a open-and-close top with a tab.<br /><br />The manufacturer could simply change the bulk packaging to a bag.  Frankly, a Ziploc bag would be just as functional (and probably have a lower manufacturing cost) than the box.\n",
      "Since all Greenies are the same I would suppose that only the suppliers of Greenies could make the difference, and this one certainly did!<br />We received our order for an amazing cocker spaniel in very good time, which made us all very happy!<br />And as far as price goes, that was really a surprise!<br />Even with postage these healthy treats cost less than we had been paying for them in pet stores here in Salt Lake City!<br />You can surely look forward to many more orders from us!<br />Thanks for the great treatment!!!!<br />Ray, Joan and Taz<br /><br />PS  I HAVE NO IDEA OF HOW THE IDENTIFYING PICTURE OF THE PRODUCT I REVIEWED GOT SWITCHED!<br /><br />HOWEVER, PLEASE DO NOT LET YOUR DOG EAT THE MICROFIBER CLOTHS (EVEN THE GREEN ONES)!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "I gave a pet dog plural resemblance products, but have got tired directly so far.<br />However, the pet dog continues Greenies and wants it.\n",
      "My Shih Tzu is seven and has had one Greenie a day for years.  She is happy, healthy and has great teeth.  She begs for her Greenie every morning.  Don't worry about Greenies causing allergies!  The main source of allergies is CORN in dog food.  Do your little one a favor and go to a grain free or reduced grain dog food.  When you think about it, wild dogs didn't eat corn meal!  If your little one has allergies, you will be amazed at the immediate healing.\n",
      "I would not only order from this seller again, I have also told all my friends about this seller's store!\n",
      "My AKC English Bulldog has been using greenies since he was a puppy, and hasnt had any problems with it. Ive always given him the correct size greenie for his weight, and have never had to take him to the vet. (yet I never leave him unattended with his greenie) The only problem I had with this particular seller was the picture on display, and what I recieved in the mail. Please don't make the same mistake I did, there are only 17 greenies in the box, would have been better off buying them at Petsmart.\n",
      "I am sad to say that my dogs are completely addicted to Greenies. They get one every night after our walk and they never let us forget. Once we get inside they go right to their crates and sit and wait until their treats are given. Good treat for small dogs and a great price on amazon.\n",
      "The Greenies ordered through Amazon is less expensive than the \"bricks & mortar\" stores; and I plan to order another box.  We received the product a few days after placing the order.<br /><br />Terrific product, and our lab loves this treat!\n",
      "my dog brandi lovessssssssssssssssssss these greenies she cant get enough of them and i keep them in cabinet she will look at cabinet and than look at me and say ma can i please have a greenie im not kiddin shes a dog but she talks to me they have there own communication.<br />anyway whoever is leary about buying these trust me when i tell you they are worth every pennie and this seller got them out to me quick!!great product great seller what more can i say but<br />merry xmas and a happy healthy new year too!!\n",
      "Our two greyhounds love the Greenies dental chews.  I prefer to buy them the smaller treats since they are both seniors now and don't like to chew on things for extended periods of time.  The regular size fits that need.\n",
      "When we opened the box, we found it to be full of small worms. My husband was able to remove them with a small brush but they shouldn't have been there in the first place. We have gone through many many boxes of greenies and this is the first time we found worms in them. The dogs love the greenies and it helps their teeth a lot.\n",
      "As always, amazing price on amazon. Paid the same price for 45 chews, as I did for half the amount at the local pet store. Product shipped extremely quick even using the super saver shipping. My dog absolutely loves these treats. She hates going to her crate, but if I grab one of these out of the box that it came in, show it to her, and say \"bed\" she literally sprints to her crate in anticipation. Highly Recommended. Oh and her breath is about half as stinky as it was before I started giving her these.\n",
      "Dogs LOVE Greenies. We can't even say or spell the word without our three flipping out. Their daily Greenie is the high point of their day. Greenies work as advertised, keeping their teeth white and their breath smelling as good as a dog's breath can.\n",
      "What can I say. To my dogs, giving them a Greenie is like giving them a steak! The minute they hear the box being take out of the closet they are right at my feet.\n",
      "My elderly (soon-to-be 17) beagle, Dakota, is super picky about what he eats.  Making a different dish (has to have different protein source and flavoring) every other night is the only way I can keep weight on this once food-frenzied chow hound.  The ONLY consistent item he eats -- including dog treats and human table food -- are Greenies treats.  The \"Senior\" variety is the perfect texture (softer than the regular Greenies treats) for his aging, sensitive teeth.  The inclusion of glucosamine and chondroitin to help with his joints give me hope that it helps the creaking and cracking of his joints.  Whatever the formula they use to make it easier to digest is a plus since I know his aging system doesn't work as well in his older years.  Dakota gets one petite Greenies Senior treat everyday and he has never turned down an offer for one yet.\n",
      "These are recommended by all vets that I've seen.  They are healthy, clean teeth and my dog loves them.  I cut them in half though as if he eats a whole (large) one, his tummy doesn't like it.  He has a VERY sensitive stomach though.\n",
      "This is my second box of greenies that I have been quite pleased up until today.  I pull out on greenie and found a WORM along with larvae!! This is horrible.  I had this box for 3 months.  I emptied the box and found about a dozen more worms and was disgusted.  I couldn't believe greenies product was contaminating my dogs.  The expiration date is dated 2013 so this clearly shows that there is something wrong with this product.  I hope someone from the greenies department will give contact me to fix this.  I will be posting these comments on every doggy treat review forum/website until I hear from someone so I know that they are trying to fix it and shows how much they value their customers and product.  I don't know how long I have been feeding greenies with worms in them so my two pups will now have to go to the vet.\n",
      "I had good results with this product six months ago.  However, a second purchase that I just opened caused all of my three dogs to vomit within minutes of eating the product.  I removed other items from their diet to be sure and it did it again, instantly. I contacted the company about it and they have claimed no other problems exist(suggesting I must have tainted the product or have exposed it to an environment making the dog snacks unstable, or the company I purchased them from somehow did something to the product. Hmm: sounds troubling to me, especially from the factory.). I have seen other issues out there regarding this product, which vary.  Use your own methods of making a control group, but be sure to see they have proper bowel movements and are not vomiting after you feed them the product.  Secondly, Greenies.com(the Nutro Company) will not honor purchases made through unauthorized vendors.  Amazon directly is an \"authorized vendor\".  \"Monster Pets\" is not authorized to resell these items and only those vendors listed on their website are \"authorized\".  They will only help you return/refund something if it was purchased through an \"authorized\" vendor.  This now makes me leery of items purchased through \"Amazon Marketplace\", particularly food items.  Buyer beware!  Caveat emptor!\n",
      "My dog won't eat these things. I can offer her nothing else to eat all day and she still will literally turn her back and walk away from these things. I tried gifting them to another small dog owner, only to find they are warned against as a choking hazard. Turns out they are so gummy that they sometimes get stuck in a dog's throat and choke the poor thing to death. Maybe my dog knew something I didn't... or maybe they just don't taste or smell that good to some dogs. Buyer beware. (Message me if you want an almost full 96 count box for just the cost of shipping, since if you are going to buy them, I hate to throw away something someone else can use.)\n",
      "My dog loves her greenies, she gets one every morning, if I forget to give her one she lets me know it in no uncertain terms.<br />I buy them from Amazon because the price is right, petsmart wants to much for them.<br />I just ordered them yesterday, received them today.<br /><br />Thanks\n",
      "Nice to have a box to store the greenies, but the lid doesn't really fit back on once you open it, it's really flimsy plastic.  Inside is a ziploc bag of greenies.\n",
      "This product is just what we wanted. Doggie loves them,and I can hardly believe how fast they got here. Excellent seller.....Bunny\n",
      "I was all set to buy these thinking they'd be great for my dog.  Then I found:<br /><br />\"At least 13 dogs have died after being fed the top-selling pet treat in the country, owners and veterinarians have told CNN. The problem comes because the treats, called Greenies, become lodged in a dog's esophagus or intestine and then some veterinarians say they don't break down. A CNN investigation uncovered 40 cases since 2003 where a veterinarian had to extract a Greenie from a dog after the treat became lodged either in the animal's esophagus or intestine. In 13 of those cases, the pet died.\"<br /><br />The directions also tell customers to monitor dogs to ensure the treat is adequately chewed and to always offer water after feeding. \"Gulping any item can be harmful or even fatal to a dog,\" the directions say.<br /><br />Some vets and pet owners say the directions are unrealistic.  \"These things tend to be wolfed down,\" said Dr. Brendan McKiernan, a board certified internist at the Wheat Ridge Animal Hospital outside Denver. \"They are meant to be chewed carefully, but that's like giving a sharp knife to your 2-year-old. Dogs can't be controlled that way.\"  [...]<br /><br />Even though the info from these links may be BEFORE they improved them, and considering the following quote:  \"At the end of the day ... literally millions of Greenies are enjoyed by dogs on a weekly basis with absolutely no incidents,\"<br />[...]<br /><br />I'm still extremely leary.\n",
      "Just opened Greenies Joint Care (individually sealed) in December 2011 and found small worm crawling all over it.  Next one looked fine, but really supposed to trust these now?\n",
      "I expected to recieve a box of Greenies, which is why I ordered this.  I thought that it would be a nice and neat way to store them.  Instead what I recieved was a bubble bag full of individually wrapped greenies.  Not neat and easily stored at all.  The picture of this item shows a box, but I did not recieve a box of greenies.  I wish I would have just ordered the bag of greenies, with the ziploc top, at least that is easily stored.  My dog also has a sensitive stomach and food allergies, even though greenies don't have corn in them he still pukes them up and doesn't seem interested in them when I try to give him one.  My larger dog has the bigger size and he likes them just fine, so I guess it just depends on your dog.  My main complain about this purchase was that I didn't recieve the box of greenies that is described.  Maybe they ran out and just threw 45 individually wrapped greenies in a bubble mailer, either way, that was disappointing.\n",
      "Bought the big box to be economical..bad choice. My dog ate one reluctantly and then never ate another--and this was over months.  I gave them to a friend.  My friend who owns a dog store said that many dogs have digestive upset with these, so I'm not sad that my dog didn't like them.\n",
      "From a taste perspective, your dog will probably love this product; however, I do not recommend that you buy it for your dog.  As with any dental treat, the purpose is for the dog to chew it and work the toothpaste that is in the treat around the teeth to get them nice and clean.  The problem with this treat is that dogs will literally eat them in three bites, which means that the treat is not working on the teeth.  Also, because the dog eats them in three bites, this product is much more likely to put your dog at risk of choking on them.  This product is very expensive and, from my opinion, I just don't recommend them.\n",
      "I ordered 3 packs of 27-count greenie dog chews from Entirely Pets and have ordered this product from various sources for many years. I have now opened the 2nd pack and both were the same:  all of the greenies were stuck together in one big lump.  I had to forcibly pull them apart.  Although I didn't try them myself, it leads me to believe these are old products and probably stale.  I will not order from this vendor again, even if it is a buck or so cheaper.\n",
      "Supposed to be for cleaning their teeth - right...  well - that would assume they held up to some for of chewing...  our little Border TERRIER (not Collie) \"eats\" one of these in about 5 minutes...  too fast to be of any use to the teeth and almost too fast to cause concern in the digestive tract.  Bummer too because these are supposed to be great for pups teeth...  just an agressive chewer defeats Greenie...  that's all.\n",
      "I have bought greenies for my dog for 7 years (since she was a puppy). She has always had digestive problems, but we didn't know why. While googling greenies a couple of weeks ago, I found that several dogs have died because they were not able to digest greenies. Please do some research before buying this product again. It could save your dog's life. Since switching to another dog treat, my dog has not had any problems (although it has only been two weeks).\n",
      "I thought the greenies were the petite size for small dogs instead they were much larger. I'm having to cut them in half for my 6# Yorkie.\n",
      "I'm a fan of Greenies for dogs. However, this size is just too small and almost immediately snap in half. The issue with that is they end up chewing each 1/2 down to a size that is easy to gag and choke on. Part of the advantage to Greenies is that they're supposed to break down to tiny bits that are easily swallowed. These breaking in half defeats the purpose.<br /><br />For puppies and even for grown up tiny dogs I recommend going one size up.\n",
      "Had to buy another box of the same thing at Petsmart. She eats those.  Must not be fresh.  How can you tell when they look the same.\n",
      "Our dogs liked them OK...but!~....Greenies Dental Chews for Dogs, Teenie Pack, 96 Chews....they are pricey and our two pooches love ....Veggi Dental Chews ...that's all we buy them now on Amazon of course!~\n",
      "My dogs MUST HAVE a daily Greenie 1st thing in the morning.  If I run out, there is hell to pay. If they wake before me, they start licking my face so bad that I have to wash it!  I have 2 Maltese and they literally start dancing when I bring out the box. Last order I made a mistake and bought 6 boxes. So I should be set for a while.<br />27 ounce 96 count teenie tub pack<br /><br />I DONT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU CAN SELL USED GREENIES.  PLEASE EXPLAIN.<br /><br />I also purchased a Kindle.  I LOVE IT. I have optic neuritis from Multiple Sclerosis and I am now able to read by adjusting the font.<br />I am dissapointed  that the letters are wearing off and the covers are so expensive.  My cousin made me a beautiful one out of quilt. Much nicer than the $50+++ ones from Amazon. I TOLD HER SHE SHOULD SELL THEM.\n",
      "Dogs love them, this box was economical as compared to vet prices, BUT they by no means help my dog's bad breath.  I get stared down every night at \"TREAT TIME\" by my golden retrieve and sheltie, until I am forced to get out of my comfy chair and give them their EXPECTED DESSERT every single night.  As always, my dogs walk all over me! lol\n",
      "I am writing this because this product KILLED my in-laws 2 year old YORKIE. They have been breeding Yorkies for 18 years and this was the first product they have used, that KILLED one of there dogs. They started using this product this past summer. Sweetie (the dog) was chewing on the GREENIE chew in front of both of them, when she started convulsing.  They immediately took her a 1/2 mile to the vet, by the time they arrived there, Sweetie was DEAD.  The Greenie had Pierced her TRACHEA.  Please be aware od how dangerous these could be to small dogs.\n",
      "My pug almost died from this product. A piece did not digest and got stuck in his intestinal tract. He had to have emergency surgery and 3000.00 later is now OK. Any knowledgeable pug breeder will tell you not to feed these to your pug. All the company did was refund me 25.00 for the cost of the product.\n",

      "My  dogs love them.. They are pricey for a treat tho!<br />I did not notice any change on their teeth -plaque stayed the same.. even tho I gave it to my  dog 2 times a day for few months. Still needed to go to the vet for  deep teeth cleaning.\n",
      "My name is Duncan, and I'm a mommy's boy, and she and Dad love me so much that they give me one of these every day after supper.  They taste great and clean my teeth at the same time.  All my friends love them, too! They buy them from Amazon because the price is good.  I'm going to have them get on the automatic sending list, so I'll never run out!\n",
      "I made the mistake to give a Greeny to my puppy without reading reviews about this product. It was a bad idea. The poor puppy got very sick after eating a Greenie. He vomited and had diarrhea.<br /><br />I took him to urgent care and the Vet's verdict(informed on the X-ray)was: \"a Greenie got stocked in his intestine\".<br /><br />I was very lucky to get the puppy recovered with medicine. But surgery was being considered by the Vet (mind about $7,000). On the worst case scenario, my puppy could have died because his intestinal system was obstructed for 3-4 days.<br /><br />After this unfortunate incident, I looked-up for reviews about this unsafe product -and not to be surprised- I found several concerning stories like mine. I also learned that few dog owners have sued Greenies because they believe it was the reason that provoked an obstruction to their pets digestive system, sadly resulting on death. \"Roughly 315 million Greenies were sold last year, but the breath-freshening treats have been blamed for at least 13 pet deaths and more than two dozen complaints have been filed with the Feds\". Dogster-com<br /><br />Note that as the product label says: Greenies are not 100% digestible, and if you read with more attention, the label has a Warning saying that: dogs may get sick or even chock when ingesting a Greenie!<br /><br />At the end of the day, it's hard to believe that there are companies like Grennies that don't address these issues, and just care about marketing and profiting -not so much about producing a healthy, safe treat for our best buddies.<br /><br />In any case, I'd recommend to ask your Vet or read more dog owners reviews before giving Greenies to your dog.\n",
      "Consumers Beware of Greenie products for dogs or cats. It contains a very toxic ingriedant called, Menadione Sodium Bisulfite {MSB},which is a synthetic {man made} form of Vitamin K3 and causes cancer, organ damage {kidneys,lungs,liver,and mucous membranes}. It is also in almost All dry and canned pet foods. Chech your ingredients on All of your pet treats and foods. This will kill your pets. Check to see if BHA,BHT,and propylne glycol are listed in your treats and foods, both dry and canned. These Will Kill pets.\n",
      "Why aren't there more negative reviews on the site?  Greenies are known for the harm they've caused many dogs; just look it up to see for yourself.<br />Years ago, my Pomeranian died due to biting off a chunk of a Greenie bone and having it obstruct her intestine.<br />It was a painful and horrific death and I found out the same thing has happened to many other dogs to the fact that they are full of cellulose fiber.  There are many other types of teeth-cleaning bones out there that WON'T seriously injure your dogs.  They're probably cheaper as well.\n",
      "Bought these for my little shih-tzu a few months ago and he just will not eat or even chew on these things. And he's a chewer! Chews on everything else in the house, anyway. I tried coating it in peanut butter and he ate the first one, but the next time I tried he knew I was trying to trick him and wouldn't go near it.\n",
      "I'm not sure how much I like this product because I'm always a little concerned our puppies might choke on the Greenies which tend to be a bit small.  When it comes to oral hygiene, I actually prefer the CET chews:  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P3PR54\">C.E.T. Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews for Petite Dogs, 30 Chews</a>.  Having said that, if you already know you like Greenies, this seems to be the best price anywhere...\n",
      "I'll admit, I am reviewing a product I have not used.  The reason is that wheat gluten is about the #1 cause of allergies in dogs.  When wheat gluten is broken down it gets very sticky, so it coats the cilia of the digestive tract.  This can cause irritation, and cause the immune system to actually destroy the lining of the intestines.  This means that your pup might not be able to absorb all the nutrients he is eating.<br /><br />Often allergies show up as 'hot spots' where the dog gets itchy and possibly scratches fur off.  The problem with food allergies is it's possible that they won't be obvious because all the damage will be internal.<br /><br />So, I have not seen a problem with this product, but I have known dogs who have had terrible reactions to wheat.  It's the same things as \"gluten intolerance\"in humans, but it's much more common in dogs who are not quite as good at digesting grains.  Wheat flour can be bad enough, but including concentrated wheat protein is much worse - because that is what causes the allergies.\n",
      "I have an almost two year old lab mix named Ares. I willingly admit to spoiling him and didnt mind getting him these over priced treats. His vet told us that his joints were in need of attention so I took it upon myself to buy Greenies treats that support joint care for large dogs. I started with a small bag to see if he liked them which he did. He was in love with them. I noticed he had a bit more gas than usual coupled with some less solid poop, but I didnt really read to much into it. After giving him these treats he farted almost constantly! He also had diarrhea on a regular basis.Within a week of feeding him these on a regular basis he would stay in the squatting poop position for about three to five minutes every time he pooped trying to get more out. Once he got to the point that he was leaking diarrhea onto my floor it hit me. I called his vet who advised me to discontinue use of this horrid product. After which I looked up reviews and was horrified at what I read. This stuff is posion. Its killing dogs and cats. DONT LOSE YOUR BEST FRIEND OR WASTE YOUR MONEY! Find a better product. Your best friend deserves it.\n",
      "I bought two of these at a pet store. One for 100lb plus dogs. My lab is 45 lbs. She consumed it in minutes.<br />I also got a small one for my older chihuahua mix, she consumed it within minutes.<br />Long lasting they are not !<br /><br />Bull sticks are the only item I have found that last a while. However they smell bad. Even the so called orderless ones.\n",
      "Do not buy these for your dog! I made the mistake of not researching Greenies Dental Chews online before buying these. If you Google the Greenies and how sick it may make your dog you will be shocked these are still on the market. Dogs have died eating this deadly poisonous treat.<br /><br />I saw the reviews on this product and I bought the teenies for my Yorkshire Terrier and gave it to him at night after his dinner. I figured since its for 5-15 lb dogs and his first time, I'll give him just half of the teenie. The next morning he didn't eat and he threw up bile and some of the food he ate from the night before. And remember I only gave him 1/2 a piece; imagine if I gave him an entire piece, it might get obstructed in his intestines.<br /><br />I complained to Amazon and they wanted to send me a replacement. Seriously? Like after all that for making my dog sick, you think that I should try it again? Plus they wanted the Greenies back. For what? To resell this poison? They wouldn't even mail me a box to return it. Eventually they just decided to send me a refund and that I can discard the Greenies.<br /><br />I just want to warn pet owners of this danger. There are plenty of similar complaints on this product if you research online. Please take care of your pets!\n",
      "I ordered the large size but received the regular size for dogs 25-50 lbs.  My dog is 75 lbs and needs the other size.\n",
      "I ordered the Teenie pack of Greenies that was supposed to come with 96 teenie sized chews. I ended up receiving a pack with 52 teenie sized chews and 8 large chews. I returned the product because I did not receive what I ordered. Amazon couldn't replace my order because they couldn't guarantee I would get the right product if ordered again.\n",
      "Read the stories online....dogs have died from Greenies.  I gave my 50lb pound dog Greenies for the first time 2 weeks ago, and she became very very sick for more than a week.  She was vomiting and having potty issues the entire time.  These cause blockages and do not allow the dog to fully digest.  I can't believe these are still on the market.<br /><br />From one loving pet owner to another - DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE GIVING YOUR DOGS GREENIES!  TRUST ME.\n",
      "The ad says 30 regular greenies, but the package I received says<br />27 greenies.\n",
      "We have two St. Bernards, one of whom is close to ancient, and last year she developed a dental problem.  Someone mentioned GREENIES and off we went to find our old girl something to help her age gracefully and hopefully without pain.  Well, she just loved them - as did the younger Saint - and here we are a couple of thousand dollars later wondering how to wean at least the younger dog off these obviously addictive green hard gel bones that don't have a single expensive ingredient in them.  The packaging, however, is nicer than that of most department stores but just how many of those boxes do I really want?<br /><br />I have calculated that the most expensive dentist around here would have cost less than the dent Greenies have made in my pocketbook.  So this is a warning to first time browsers - move on to another product that might well do the job for a third of the money.  A stop at your local butcher's shop could be cost saving compared to these overpriced pieces of strange green.  Someone should tell these folks that we are inching toward a depression because to date their reaction to what must be declining sales is to just keep upping the price.\n",
      "I do not recommend these for people.  My dog seemed to enjoy them.  They were too big for my cat.\n",
      "hello,<br /><br />i don't care if it's manufacturer's or Amazon's description, but it's weak. 1, you can't blow up product picture. 2. description is inconsistent. sometimes it states quantity in box, but most of the time, it does not, as with this size \"petite\". by the way, can someone tell the manufacturer it's bad french, there's no \"e\" at the end?!<br /><br />thanks\n",
      "The thing I like about the senior Greenies is that they seem a little bit softer than regular Greenies, so they are easier on my dogs' teeth (I have 6 dogs, 5 seniors and only my 9-toothed senior Doxie doesn't eat them).\n",
      "I have five dogs and feed these daily to help keep their teeth clean.  My only complaint is that they are quite expensive to feed on a daily basis.  Wish there was a way to buy them in bulk.\n",
      "These are great for small dogs. I have two dachshunds and I love that these are lower in calories. I cut them in half because they get more than one per day. They like them as much as the regular ones.\n",
      "My dogs get more excited over Greenies than any other treat.  I have one German Shorthair that is a notoriously finicky eater, and she has flat-out refused many varieties of dental bones.  Not only do the Greenies do a great job of keeping her teeth clean, but she practically does back flips when it's time for her daily chew.<br /><br />I have pointers between 45 and 60 pounds, and the regular size is great for them.  Greenies are not a chew that will last very long (usually about 30 seconds with my dogs) - but they do the job.  The chew's consistency is just right for a dental bone.  I give one to each dog after their evening meal, and afterwards there is no food residue left on their teeth.<br /><br />Dental bones aren't the kind of treats that I use frequently or for training.  I give 1 per day to help with oral hygiene.  Based on that use of this product I have yet to find anything that compete with Greenies.\n",
      "While my dogs do like the chews the picture is misleading. The actual package is small and so are the chews ( even the large size)<br />My dogs' breath is a bit better but I'm not sure they are worth the price.<br />I'll be trying other brands.\n",
      "This appeared to be the best price around, but I still don't like paying it!  Wish my dog would eat pigs ears, but he has to have his \"toothbrush\".  My vet also sells these and I do trust him, so maybe \"Max\" knows best.\n",
      "I have two Chihuahua/Yorkie females (age 5, both 7 pounds) and they absolutely love these -- it helps their breath smell better too.  It's a win-win situation!  I give them each one a day.  Amazon's price of $22.95 for 96 beats the price at my local pet store by a full ten dollars!\n",
      "The fur kid loves these & vet has commented on how clean her teeth are for a seven year old.  They're pricey, but for a once a day treat I think they're worth it for keeping her teeth in good condition, not to mention seeing her big grin when we open the container.  We should've named her \"Greenie\" because that one word gets her attention like nothing else will.\n",
      "I thought I would write a review because I have seen some negative ones out there. In particular, ones about dogs vomitting green sponges after eating them.<br /><br />My girlfriend and I have a little maltese (Dexter). He's a little over two years old and loves greenies. Absolutely loves them. They're his favorite treat. He loves to hide them and then go back for them later.<br /><br />A couple things to watch for... the package says to only feed them one a day. We were feeding him like 3 or 4 a day. We thought it was like a dental treat and couldn't hurt. We've cut it back to one a day and every once and awhile we'll give him two.<br /><br />Another thing, they can be messy. When we first got him and he was tiny, it would take him awhile to eat them. Once they get wet, they tend to stick to things. Now that he's older, he eats them pretty fast so there's no problem.<br /><br />We've never had him vomit from them, ever. Even when we were giving him 4 a day. He loves them and has never gotten ill from them. One time, he got into the package when we weren't paying attention and hid them all over the house so he probably has a secret stash somewhere.<br /><br />I would stick to the product recommendations (if you can) and if your dog is like ours, he'll love them.\n",
      "Dog loves these - and he's about an 85 lb chow/german mix, so the large size is good for him.  I guess these are good and healthy for dogs - supposedly they are - but they're also pretty expensive.  These are also chewy - so it only takes him about 1-minute to devour - so you may want to take that into consideration if you're looking for something that will last a little longer . . .\n",
      "I bought these without first doing some research. I was giving these to my dog for a few days, her breath was great and I felt good that her teeth were also being cleaned aside from brushing. I noticed she was getting diarrhea didnt really think it was the greenies until I did research and found alot of dogs have digestive issues over this stuff and some small dogs have even died. My dog is 60lbs not small but it was affecting her stomach. I stopped for a week and her stool was back to normal. The other day I gave her one greenie to see how she would react and 12hrs later the diarrhea is back. She had it all day yesterday and some this morning, hopefully tomorrow it is all gone but these greenies are now in the garbage and I am in search of other dental chews.\n",
      "Purchased for a good price.  My Chihuahua likes them. Did a subscription and received tub for $16.92. However a week later went on line to find the subscription price had gone up to $20.99 and no notification was sent to inform me of price increase.\n",
      "After having 11 teeth pulled by the Vet, I had to find a convenient way to brush my dogs teeth.  I have used these for 6 months and he has not had any more teeth problems.  he loves the taste and he has fresh breath.\n",
      "These are great, but I read horror stories about dogs choking or being unable to digest it so I have decided not to give them to my dog anymore. However, there was an article indicating that they changed the ingredients so that there wouldn't be a choking hazard, but I would rather be safe than sorry.\n",
      "I have a little Shi-Tzu...Every day at 3:oopm she gets a greenie.She never forget,She stare at me with her lazer eyes until I go to the package and give one greenie. She loves your product and cannot live without it.\n",
      "My dog loves the Greenies and they actually do work for him as his teeth are whiter and breath is fresher.  I have tried other brands and had to come back to the Greenies!\n",
      "I have 2 small terriers who aren't really interested in any kind of dog toys (except rawhide ones, which they choke on) but they LOVE Greenies.  I can get them to do almost anything if I mention \"Greenie\".  I do wish Greenies were a little harder.  The dogs polish them off so quickly that I don't think they really are helping clean the teeth very well.\n",
      "My medium sized dog will not chew rubber bones.  So I bought greenies hoping the chewing would help keep her teeth clean.<br />she is overweight so I don't give her extra treats during the day.  Unfortunately the Greenies are not as hard as I thought, she is able to bite off and swallow the pieces within a minute or two.\n",
      "The dental chews were the right size for my golden retrievers.  They love them.  The chews arrived promptly and in good condition.\n",
      "My dogs get one greenie everyday.  I like that they offer a lite version.  I was giving them the teenie version that has 96 greenies which took less than 1 minute to consume.  Since they are 14 lbs and 19 lbs, I'm happy that they offer the petite size which takes them a couple minutes to consume.\n",
      "Bentley LOVES Greenies!  He has a lot of tartar and he is only 2 1/2 so we use them hoping it helps.  He gets one every night if he has finished all his food.  He will go to the closet and cry if I forget.  All I have to say is \"puppy crack\"  and he goes crazy for it!  It seems to be helping, but I can't really tell but we will continue using it always.  I priced them several places and Amazon was the best deal.\n",
      "All my dogs have absolutely loved Greenies, though my latest little guy tends to gain weight in the winter, hence Greenies Lite!  This is the treat that my dogs will literally DANCE for, so when I can find these tubs for a great price, I grab them!  They really do prevent stinky breath and keep his six-year old doggy teeth looking good.  This was a \"home-run\" hit under the Christmas tree!\n",
      "Heaven forbid that I should run out of these, so I usually order more than one box at the time. My dogs are small, so I always buy the LITE Teenie Greenies. My dogs love these so much they will do anything I ask them to do just to get one. They will come to me when I call them, no matter where they are, if they think they'll get a greenie reward. I give each one of my two little dogs a greenie everynight before their bedtime, and they know the routine so well till one of them runs to her bed and actually opens up her kennel door with her paws, then climbs in and waits for her greenie. I have never seen a dog yet who did not love greenies.  Even my almost toothless fourteen year old schnauzer loves her some greenies.\n",
      "My dogs go crazy for these! It really does help w their bad breath, and it keeps them busy for a little bit.\n",
      "great value, arrived quickly.  My two dogs love these treats and they are great for their teeth. Another great purchase\n",
      "I have 2 small dogs, that absolutely love greenies, In stores such as pets mart or pet co they want $35+ on sale for a pack this large. I always order on amazon. who doesn't want to spoil their dogs at a great price while keeping their teeth white and gums healthy.\n",
      "my dog loves her greenies, and it is better to buy them in a tub-pak because you get more for your money\n",
      "My Black Lab loves these treats, I need to keep them on hand so I buy two boxes at a time. The ziplock bag closure keeps the treats fresh and keeps the pantry from smelling like greenies (nice for the dog, not for us). This also appears to be the best pricing.\n",
      "My two dogs love them. All I have to say is it's greenie time. I have checked their teeth and they have improved so much. My vet recommended them and I'm glad that I bought them. Amazon delivery was fantasticly fast!\n",
      "Greenies are a great product that dogs love and while they are enjoying their daily treat, they are actually keeping their teeth  and gums clean.  I always share the information on Greenies when people ask how I keep my 6 year old Yellow Labradors teeth so clean.  I'd always thought they were a bit expensive but Amazon has brought them to us at a more affordable price.  We have chosen the lite variety to keep our lab a bit trimmer in weight.  A good product at a reasonable price....Thanks\n",
      "This is a great product. My dogs love them. In fact they will fight over who gets one first. The teenies are the perfect size. It is one of the few treats I can safely offer my smallest yorkie. They both seem to listen very well when I pull out the bag.<br /><br />My vet says that for yorkies they both have very little plague. It beats trying to use the small brushes to brush their teeth.\n",
      "I recently found Greenies at Amazon. My dogs love them and I found them cheaper on Amazon than I can get them locally.They are a treat that, also, keeps their teeth cleaner and their breath smells good. When my dogs are happy, I'm happy and with Amazon's price, my wallet is happy!!!!!\n",
      "I purchased these for my 19 lb beagle.  They actually came in a holiday box (I didn't know this until I opened my amazon box), which would've been great had I been giving them as a gift.  They are the perfect size for my dog, and she devours them!  Note:  It is recommended that you give your dog only one treat per day.\n",
      "I am happy with the service of this company.  Fast shipping and great communication.  Also, the product helps keep my dogs teeth clean and breath smelling great.  My dog gets Greenies every night and reminds me at 8 PM that it is time for Greenies.\n",
      "I was a skeptic.  I thought I would have to have my dogs teeth cleaned by a vet at a cost of $150.00 plus.  Their breath would knock over a horse.  Then I heard of Greenies!  Wow can I say, bright teeth and great breath and I feed them only 1/2 of a regular one a day.  They love them! Great product, fast shipping, there is nothing more that needs to be said.\n",
      "Make sure you have a small dog...Big Dogs might choke on these if they get to anxious...  But there are a ton in this box - a great value and they do whiten the teeth very well - see all the great reviews.  Help your dogs teeth if you don't want to brush them like me.\n",
      "These are the best things since sliced bread.  I have been giving my dogs this treat for quite awhile.  My dogs love them and they were very reasonably priced.  I paid you $18.95 plus shipping and at Petsmart they are $32.99 plus tax for the exact same amount.  Thanks for the good buy.<br /><br />Sincerely<br />Danny Knowles\n",
      "My dog loves these.  I received a sample at the vet's office where I got my puppy and he loved them.  I like the fact that they help to clean his teeth as well as satisfy his need to chew.\n",
      "Oh my gosh, we cannot be without Greenies at our house or I will have a very unhappy doggie.  She seems to know the exact time of day that she will get her greenie, and just wags and begs for it right after dinner.  I order from Amazon because the price is the best I have found and the delivery is fast and convenient.<br />I am a huge fan of Amazon, they treat their customers right and makes all purchases/returns very easy.\n",
      "Same thing you buy for a lot more at other stores. Not much more to say about.  I love it, she loves it, and I've bought it again numerous times.\n"
